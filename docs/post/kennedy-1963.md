Remarks in the Rudolph Wilde Platz, Berlin   
June 26, 1963

I am proud to come to this city as the guest of your distinguished Mayor, who has symbolized throughout the world the fighting spirit of West Berlin. And I am proud to visit the Federal Republic with your distinguished Chancellor who for so many years has committed Germany to democracy and freedom and progress, and to come here in the company of my fellow American, General Clay, who has been in this city during its great moments of crisis and will come again if ever needed.

Two thousand years ago the proudest boast was "civis Romanus sum." Today, in the world of freedom, the proudest boast is "Ich bin ein Berliner."

I appreciate my interpreter translating my German!

There are many people in the world who really don't understand, or say they don't, what is the great issue between the free world and the Communist world. Let them come to Berlin. There are some who say that communism is the wave of the future. Let them come to Berlin. And there are some who say in Europe and elsewhere we can work with the Communists. Let them come to Berlin. And there are even a few who say that it is true that communism is an evil system, but it permits us to make economic progress. Lass' sie nach Berlin kommen. Let them come to Berlin.

Freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect, but we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in, to prevent them from leaving us. I want to say, on behalf of my countrymen, who live many miles away on the other side of the Atlantic, who are far distant from you, that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with you, even from a distance, the story of the last 18 years. I know of no town, no city, that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force, and the hope and the determination of the city of West Berlin. While the wall is the most obvious and vivid demonstration of the failures of the Communist system, for all the world to see, we take no satisfaction in it, for it is, as your Mayor has said, an offense not only against history but an offense against humanity, separating families, dividing husbands and wives and brothers and sisters, and dividing a people who wish to be joined together.

What is true of this city is true of Germany-real, lasting peace in Europe can never be assured as long as one German out of four is denied the elementary right of free men, and that is to make a free choice. In 18 years of peace and good faith, this generation of Germans has earned the right to be free, including the right to unite their families and their nation in lasting peace, with good will to all people. You live in a defended island of freedom, but your life is part of the main. So let me ask you, as I close, to lift your eyes beyond the dangers of today, to the hopes of tomorrow, beyond the freedom merely of this city of Berlin, or your country of Germany, to the advance of freedom everywhere, beyond the wall to the day of peace with justice, beyond yourselves and ourselves to all mankind.

Freedom is indivisible, and when one man is enslaved, all are not free. When all are free, then we can look forward to that day when this city will be joined as one and this country and this great Continent of Europe in a peaceful and hopeful globe. When that day finally comes, as it will, the people of West Berlin can take sober satisfaction in the fact that they were in the front lines for almost two decades.

All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin, and, therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the words "Ich bin ein Berliner."

**我是柏林人**  
——柏林墙下的演说(在柏林鲁道夫·王尔德广场的讲话)

我很自豪能作为尊敬的市长的客人来到这座城市，他象征着西柏林的战斗精神。我很自豪地与尊敬的总理一起访问联邦德国，他多年来一直致力于德国的民主、自由和进步，并在我的美国同胞克莱将军的陪伴下来到这里，他在这座城市的危机时刻一直在这座城市，如果需要，他会再来。

二千年前，最骄傲的自夸是“我是罗马人”（拉丁语）。
今天，在自由世界，最骄傲的自夸是“我是柏林人”（德语）。

世上有许多人确实不理解，或者说他们不明白，自由世界与共产主义世界的巨大鸿沟。让他们来柏林吧。
有些人说，共产主义是未来的潮流。让他们来柏林吧。
有些人说，我们可以在欧洲或是他地方与共产党合作。让他们来柏林吧。
甚至有几个人说，共产主义系统固然邪恶，但它可以使我们的经济取得进展。让他们来柏林看看吧（德语）。让他们来柏林吧。

自由困难重重，民主亦非尽善尽美。但我们从未建起一堵墙将我们的人民囚禁其中，不让他们离开我们。
我想说，我远居千里之外的大西洋彼岸的同胞们。他们会为能在过去十八年间与你们共同的经历而深感自豪。
我不知道哪个小镇，哪个城市，可以像西柏林一样在被围困十八年后，依然拥有如此的生机与力量，希望与决心。
这堵墙最生动地展现了共产主义系统的失败。全世界都能看到，我们并不会为此妥协。正如你们的市长所说，这堵墙不仅是对历史，也是对整个人类的侵犯。它使家庭分裂，妻离子散，骨肉分离。将祈求统一的人民一分为二。

这便是这个城市的事实，也是德国的事实――只要四个德国人中有一个被剥夺了自由人的基本权利――也就是选择自由的权利，欧洲的持久和平便不会实现。
经历了十八年和平与友善之后，这一代德国人终于赢得了自由的权利，拥有了家人团聚，国家统一的权利。
你们住在一座受保护的自由之岛上，但你们的生活只是沧海一粟。
所以在结束前我请求你们抬起目光，越过今天的危险看到明日的希望；越过柏林的自由看到祖国的统一；超越自由与一切，越过这堵墙看到和平与公正降临之日，超越自己，超越全人类。

自由不可分割，只要一人被奴役，所有人都不自由。
当所有的人都获得自由之时，我们便可以展望柏林，德国与欧洲大陆在和平与希望的光芒中获得统一的那一日。
当这一日终将来临之时――正如它必将来临之时，西柏林的人民将会为自己在将近二十年间坚守在第一线而感到欣慰。

一切自由人，无论他们身处何方，都是柏林市民。作为一个自由人，我为“我是柏林人”而自豪。
