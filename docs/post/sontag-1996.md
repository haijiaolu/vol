CINEMA’S 100 YEARS SEEM TO HAVE THE SHAPE OF A LIFE cycle: an inevitable
birth, the steady accumulation of glories and the onset in the last decade of
an ignominious, irreversible decline. It’s not that you can’t look forward
anymore to new films that you can admire. But such films not only have to be
exceptions -- that’s true of great achievements in any art. They have to be
actual violations of the norms and practices that now govern movie making
everywhere in the capitalist and would-be capitalist world -- which is to say,
everywhere. And ordinary films, films made purely for entertainment (that is,
commercial)purposes, are astonishingly witless; the vast majority fail
resoundingly to appeal to their cynically targeted audiences. While the point
of a great film is now, more than ever, to be a one-of-a-kind achievement, the
commercial cinema has settled for a policy of bloated, derivative film-making,
a brazen combinatory or recombinatory art, in the hope of reproducing past
successes. Cinema, once heralded as the art of the 20th century, seems now, as
the century closes numerically, to be a decadent art.

Perhaps it is not cinema that has ended but only cinephilia -- the name of the
very specific kind of love that cinema inspired. Each art breeds its fanatics.
The love that cinema inspired, however, was special. It was born of the
conviction that cinema was an art unlike any other: quintessentially modern;
distinctively accessible; poetic and mysterious and erotic and moral -- all at
the same time. Cinema had apostles. (It was like religion.)Cinema was a
crusade. For cinephiles, the movies encapsulated everything. Cinema was both
the book of art and the book of life.

As many people have noted, the start of movie making a hundred years ago was,
conveniently, a double start. In roughly the year 1895, two kinds of films
were made, two modes of what cinema could be seemed to emerge: cinema as the
transcription of real unstaged life (the Lumiere brothers)and cinema as
invention, artifice, illusion, fantasy (Melies). But this is not a true
opposition. The whole point is that, for those first audiences, the very
transcription of the most banal reality -- the Lumiere brothers filming “The
Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station” -- was a fantastic experience. Cinema
began in wonder, the wonder that reality can be transcribed with such
immediacy. All of cinema is an attempt to perpetuate and to reinvent that
sense of wonder.

Everything in cinema begins with that moment, 100 years ago, when the train
pulled into the station. People took movies into themselves, just as the
public cried out with excitement, actually ducked, as the train seemed to move
toward them. Until the advent of television emptied the movie theaters, it was
from a weekly visit to the cinema that you learned (or tried to learn)how to
walk, to smoke, to kiss, to fight, to grieve. Movies gave you tips about how
to be attractive. Example: It looks good to wear a raincoat even when it isnt
raining. But whatever you took home was only a part of the larger experience
of submerging yourself in lives that were not yours. The desire to lose
yourself in other people’s lives ... faces. This is a larger, more inclusive
form of desire embodied in the movie experience. Even more than what you
appropriated for yourself was the experience of surrender to, of being
transported by, what was on the screen. You wanted to be kidnapped by the
movie -- and to be kidnapped was to be overwhelmed by the physical presence of
the image. The experience of “going to the movies” was part of it. To see a
great film only on television isn’t to have really seen that film. It’s not
only a question of the dimensions of the image: the disparity between a
larger-than-you image in the theater and the little image on the box at home.
The conditions of paying attention in a domestic space are radically
disrespectful of film. Now that a film no longer has a standard size, home
screens can be as big as living room or bedroom walls. But you are still in a
living room or a bedroom. To be kidnapped, you have to be in a movie theater,
seated in the dark among anonymous strangers.

No amount of mourning will revive the vanished rituals -- erotic, ruminative
-- of the darkened theater. The reduction of cinema to assaultive images, and
the unprincipled manipulation of images (faster and faster cutting)to make
them more attention-grabbing, has produced a disincarnated, lightweight cinema
that doesn’t demand anyone’s full attention. Images now appear in any size and
on a variety of surfaces: on a screen in a theater, on disco walls and on
megascreens hanging above sports arenas. The sheer ubiquity of moving images
has steadily undermined the standards people once had both for cinema as art
and for cinema as popular entertainment.

In the first years there was, essentially, no difference between these two
forms. And all films of the silent era -- from the masterpieces of Feuillade,
D. W. Griffith, Dziga Vertov, Pabst, Murnau and King Vidor to the most
formula-ridden melodramas and comedies -- are on a very high artistic level,
compared with most of what was to follow. With the coming of sound, the image
making lost much of its brilliance and poetry, and commercial standards
tightened. This way of making movies -- the Hollywood system -- dominated film
making for about 25 years (roughly from 1930 to 1955). The most original
directors, like Erich von Stroheim and Orson Welles, were defeated by the
system and eventually went into artistic exile in Europe -- where more or less
the same quality-defeating system was now in place, with lower budgets; only
in France were a large number of superb films produced throughout this period.
Then, in the mid-1950’s, vanguard ideas took hold again, rooted in the idea of
cinema as a craft pioneered by the Italian films of the immediate postwar
period. A dazzling number of original, passionate films of the highest
seriousness got made.

It was at this specific moment in the 100-year history of cinema that going to
movies, thinking about movies, talking about movies became a passion among
university students and other young people. You fell in love not just with
actors but with cinema itself. Cinephilia had first become visible in the
1950’s in France: its forum was the legendary film magazine Cahiers du Cinema
(followed by similarly fervent magazines in Germany, Italy, Great Britain,
Sweden, the United States and Canada). Its temples, as it spread throughout
Europe and the Americas, were the many cinematheques and clubs specializing in
films from the past and directors’retrospectives that sprang up. The 1960’s
and early 1970’s was the feverish age of movie-going, with the full-time
cinephile always hoping to find a seat as close as possible to the big screen,
ideally the third row center. “One can’t live without Rossellini,” declares a
character in Bertolucci’s “Before the Revolution” (1964)-- and means it.

For some 15 years there were new masterpieces every month. How far away that
era seems now. To be sure, there was always a conflict between cinema as an
industry and cinema as an art, cinema as routine and cinema as experiment. But
the conflict was not such as to make impossible the making of wonderful films,
sometimes within and sometimes outside of mainstream cinema. Now the balance
has tipped decisively in favor of cinema as an industry. The great cinema of
the 1960’s and 1970’s has been thoroughly repudiated. Already in the 1970’s
Hollywood was plagiarizing and rendering banal the innovations in narrative
method and in the editing of successful new European and ever-marginal
independent American films. Then came the catastrophic rise in production
costs in the 1980’s, which secured the worldwide reimposition of industry
standards of making and distributing films on a far more coercive, this time
truly global scale. Soaring producton costs meant that a film had to make a
lot of money right away, in the first month of its release, if it was to be
profitable at all -- a trend that favored the blockbuster over the low-budget
film, although most blockbusters were flops and there were always a few
“small” films that surprised everyone by their appeal. The theatrical release
time of movies became shorter and shorter (like the shelf life of books in
bookstores); many movies were designed to go directly into video. Movie
theaters continued to close -- many towns no longer have even one -- as movies
became, mainly, one of a variety of habit-forming home entertainments.

In this country, the lowering of expectations for quality and the inflation of
expectations for profit have made it virtually impossible for artistically
ambitious American directors, like Francis Ford Coppola and Paul Schrader, to
work at their best level. Abroad, the result can be seen in the melancholy
fate of some of the greatest directors of the last decades. What place is
there today for a maverick like Hans- Jurgen Syberberg, who has stopped making
films altogether, or for the great Godard, who now makes films about the
history of film, on video? Consider some other cases. The internationalizing
of financing and therefore of casts were disastrous for Andrei Tarkovsky in
the last two films of his stupendous (and tragically abbreviated)career. And
how will Aleksandr Sokurov find the money to go on making his sublime films,
under the rude conditions of Russian capitalism?

Predictably, the love of cinema has waned. People still like going to the
movies, and some people still care about and expect something special,
necessary from a film. And wonderful films are still being made: Mike Leigh’s
“Naked,” Gianni Amelio’s “Lamerica,” Fred Kelemen’s “Fate.” But you hardly find
anymore, at least among the young, the distinctive cinephilic love of movies
that is not simply love of but a certain taste in films (grounded in a vast
appetite for seeing and reseeing as much as possible of cinema’s glorious
past). Cinephilia itself has come under attack, as something quaint, outmoded,
snobbish. For cinephilia implies that films are unique, unrepeatable, magic
experiences. Cinephilia tells us that the Hollywood remake of Godard’s
“Breathless” cannot be as good as the original. Cinephilia has no role in the
era of hyperindustrial films. For cinephilia cannot help, by the very range
and eclecticism of its passions, from sponsoring the idea of the film as,
first of all, a poetic object; and cannot help from inciting those outside the
movie industry, like painters and writers, to want to make films, too. It is
precisely this notion that has been defeated.

If cinephilia is dead, then movies are dead too ... no matter how many movies,
even very good ones, go on being made. If cinema can be resurrected, it will
only be through the birth of a new kind of cine-love.

**A Century of Cinema**
1995

> 《Where the Stress Falls》（《重点所在》）第二部分《SEEING》

CINEMA’S HUNDRED YEARS appear to have the shape of a life
cycle: an inevitable birth, the steady accumulation of glories, and the onset
in the last decade of an ignominious, irreversible decline. This doesn’t mean
that there won’t be any more new films one can admire. But such films will
not simply be exceptions; that’s true of great achievement in any art. They
will have to be heroic violations of the norms and practices which now
govern moviemaking everywhere in the capitalist and would-be capitalist
world—which is to say, everywhere. And ordinary films, films made purely
for entertainment (that is, commercial)purposes, will continue to be
astonishingly witless; already the vast majority fail resoundingly to appeal
to their cynically targeted audiences. While the point of a great film is now,
more than ever, to be a one-of-a-kind achievement, the commercial cinema
has settled for a policy of bloated, derivative filmmaking, a brazen
combinatory or re-combinatory art, in the hope of reproducing past
successes. Every film that hopes to reach the largest possible audience is
designed as some kind of remake. Cinema, once heralded as the art of the
twentieth century, seems now, as the century closes numerically, to be a
decadent art.

Perhaps it is not cinema which has ended but only cinephilia—the name
of the distinctive kind of love that cinema inspired. Each art breeds its
fanatics. The love movies aroused was more imperial. It was born of the
conviction that cinema was an art unlike any other: quintessentially
modern; distinctively accessible; poetic and mysterious and erotic and
moral—all at the same time. Cinema had apostles (it was like religion).
Cinema was a crusade. Cinema was a world view. Lovers of poetry or opera
or dance don’t think there is only poetry or opera or dance. But lovers of
cinema could think there was only cinema. That the movies encapsulated
everything—and they did. It was both the book of art and the book of life.

As many have noted, the start of moviemaking a hundred years ago was,
conveniently, a double start. In that first year, 1895, two kinds of films
were
made, proposing two modes of what cinema could be: cinema as the
transcription of real, unstaged life (the Lumière brothers)and cinema as
invention, artifice, illusion, fantasy (Méliès). But this was never a true
opposition. For those first audiences watching the Lumiere brothers’The
Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station, the camera’s transmission of a banal
sight was a fantastic experience. Cinema began in wonder, the wonder that
reality can be transcribed with such magical immediacy. All of cinema is an
attempt to perpetuate and to reinvent that sense of wonder.

Everything begins with that moment, one hundred years ago, when the
train pulled into the station. People took movies into themselves, just as the
public cried out with excitement, actually ducked, as the train seemed to
move toward them. Until the advent of television emptied the movie
theatres, it was from a weekly visit to the cinema that you learned (or tried
to learn)how to strut, to smoke, to kiss, to fight, to grieve. Movies gave you
tips about how to be attractive, such as…it looks good to wear a raincoat
even when it isn’t raining. But whatever you took home from the movies
was only a part of the larger experience of losing yourself in faces, in lives
that were not yours—which is the more inclusive form of desire embodied
in the movie experience. The strongest experience was simply to surrender
to, to be transported by, what was on the screen. You wanted to be
kidnapped by the movie.

The prerequisite of being kidnapped was to be overwhelmed by the
physical presence of the image. And the conditions of“going to the
movies”secured that experience. To see a great film only on television isn’t
to have really seen that film. (This is equally true of those made for TV,
like
Fassbinder’s Berlin Alexanderplatz and the two Heimat films of Edgar
Reitz.)It’s not only the difference of dimensions: the superiority of the
larger-than-you image in the theatre to the little image on the box at home.
The conditions of paying attention in a domestic space are radically
disrespectful of film. Since film no longer has a standard size, home screens
can be as big as living room or bedroom walls. But you are still in a living
room or a bedroom, alone or with familiars. To be kidnapped, you have to
be in a movie theatre, seated in the dark among anonymous strangers.

No amount of mourning will revive the vanished rituals—erotic,
ruminative—of the darkened theatre. The reduction of cinema to assaultive
images, and the unprincipled manipulation of images (faster and faster
cutting)to be more attention-grabbing, have produced a disincarnated,
lightweight cinema that doesn’t demand anyone’s full attention. Images
now appear in any size and on a variety of surfaces: on a screen in a theatre,
on home screens as small as the palm of your hand or as big as a wall, on
disco walls and mega-screens hanging above sports arenas and the outsides
of tall public buildings. The sheer ubiquity of moving images has steadily
undermined the standards people once had both for cinema as art at its most
serious and for cinema as popular entertainment.

In the first years there was, essentially, no difference between cinema as
art and cinema as entertainment. And all films of the silent era—from the
masterpieces of Feuillade, D. W. Griffith, Dziga Vertov, Pabst, Murnau,
King Vidor to the most formula-ridden melodramas and comedies—look,
are, better than most of what was to follow. With the coming of sound, the
image-making lost much of its brilliance and poetry, and commercial
standards tightened. This way of making movies—the Hollywood system—
dominated filmmaking for about twenty-five years (roughly from 1930 to
1955). The most original directors, like Erich von Stroheim and Orson
Welles, were defeated by the system and eventually went into artistic exile
in Europe—where more or less the same quality-defeating system was in
place with lower budgets; only in France were a large number of superb
films produced throughout this period. Then, in the mid-1950s, vanguard
ideas took hold again, rooted in the idea of cinema as a craft pioneered by
the Italian films of the early postwar era. A dazzling number of original,
passionate films of the highest seriousness got made with new actors and
tiny crews, went to film festivals (of which there were more and more), and
from there, garlanded with festival prizes, into movie theatres around the
world. This golden age actually lasted as long as twenty years.

It was at this specific moment in the hundred-year history of cinema that
going to movies, thinking about movies, talking about movies became a
passion among university students and other young people. You fell in love
not just with actors but with cinema itself. Cinephilia had first become
visible in the 1950s in France: its forum was the legendary film magazine
Cahiers du Cinema (followed by similarly fervent magazines in Germany,
Italy, Great Britain, Sweden, the United States, Canada). Its temples, as it
spread throughout Europe and the Americas, were the cinematheques and
film clubs specializing in films from the past and directors’retrospectives.
The 1960s and early 1970s were the age of feverish moviegoing, with the
full-time cinephile always hoping to find a seat as close as possible to the
big screen, ideally the third row center.“One can’t live without Rossellini,”
declares a character in Bertolucci’s Before the Revolution (1964)—and
means it.

Cinephilia—a source of exultation in the films of Godard and Truffaut
and the early Bertolucci and Syberberg; a morose lament in the recent films
of Nanni Moretti—was mostly a Western European affair. The great
directors of“the other Europe”(Zanussi in Poland, Angelopoulos in
Greece, Tarkovsky and Sokurov in Russia, Jancsóand Tarr in Hungary)and
the great Japanese directors (Ozu, Mizoguchi, Kurosawa, Naruse, Oshima,
Imamura)have tended not to be cinephiles, perhaps because in Budapest or
Moscow or Tokyo or Warsaw or Athens there wasn’t a chance to get a
cinematheque education. The distinctive thing about cinephile taste was that
it embraced both“art”films and popular films. Thus, European cinephilia
had a romantic relation to the films of certain directors in Hollywood at the
apogee of the studio system: Godard for Howard Hawks, Fassbinder for
Douglas Sirk. Of course, this moment—when cinephilia emerged—was
also the moment when the Hollywood studio system was breaking up. It
seemed that moviemaking had re-won the right to experiment; cinephiles
could afford to be passionate (or sentimental)about the old Hollywood
genre films. A host of new people came into cinema, including a generation
of young film critics from Cahiers du Cinéma; the towering figure of that
generation, indeed of several decades of filmmaking anywhere, was Jean-
Luc Godard. A few writers turned out to be wildly talented filmmakers:
Alexander Kluge in Germany, Pier Paolo Pasolini in Italy. (The model for
the writer who turns to filmmaking actually emerged earlier, in France, with
Pagnol in the 1930s and Cocteau in the 1940s; but it was not until the 1960s
that this seemed, at least in Europe, normal.)Cinema appeared to be reborn.

For some fifteen years there was a profusion of masterpieces, and one
allowed oneself to imagine that this would go on forever. To be sure, there
was always a conflict between cinema as an industry and cinema as an art,
cinema as routine and cinema as experiment. But the conflict was not such
as to make impossible the making of wonderful films, sometimes within
and sometimes outside of mainstream cinema. Now the balance has tipped
decisively in favor of cinema as an industry. The great cinema of the 1960s
and 1970s has been thoroughly repudiated. Already in the 1970s Hollywood
was plagiarizing and banalizing the innovations in narrative method and
editing of successful new European and ever-marginal independent

1980s, which secured the worldwide reimposition of industry standards of
making and distributing films on a far more coercive, this time truly global,
scale. The result can be seen in the melancholy fate of some of the greatest
directors of the last decades. What place is there today for a maverick like
Hans Jürgen Syberberg, who has stopped making films altogether, or for the
great Godard, who now makes films about the history of film on video?
Consider some other cases. The internationalizing of financing and
therefore of casts was a disaster for Andrei Tarkovsky in the last two films
of his stupendous, tragically abbreviated career. And these conditions for
making films have proved to be as much an artistic disaster for two of the
most valuable directors still working: Krzysztof Zanussi (The Structure of
Crystals, Illumination, Spiral, Contract)and Theo Angelopoulos
(Reconstruction, Days of’36, The Travelling Players). And what will
happen now to Béla Tarr (Damnation, Satantango)? And how will
Aleksandr Sokurov (Save and Protect, Days of Eclipse, The Second Circle,
Stone, Whispering Pages)find the money to go on making films, his
sublime films, under the rude conditions of Russian capitalism?

Predictably, the love of cinema has waned. People still like going to the
movies, and some people still care about and expect something special,
necessary from a film. And wonderful films are still being made: Mike
Leigh’s Naked, Gianni Amelio’s Lamerica, Hou Hsiaohsien’s Goodbye
South, Goodbye, and Abbas Kiarostami’s Close-Up and Koker trilogy. But
one hardly finds anymore, at least among the young, the distinctive
cinephilic love of movies, which is not simply love of but a certain taste in
films (grounded in a vast appetite for seeing and reseeing as much as
possible of cinema’s glorious past). Cinephilia itself has come under attack,
as something quaint, outmoded, snobbish. For cinephilia implies that films

original. Cinephilia has no role in the era of hyperindustrial films. For by
the very range and eclecticism of its passions, cinephilia cannot help but
sponsor the idea of the film as, first of all, a poetic object; and cannot
help
but incite those outside the movie industry, like painters and writers, to
want to make films, too. It is precisely this that must be defeated. That has
been defeated.

If cinephilia is dead, then movies are dead…no matter how many
movies, even very good ones, go on being made. If cinema can be
resurrected, it will only be through the birth of a new kind of cine-love.

**百年电影回眸**

——苏珊·桑塔格  
（1995年）

电影的百年历史形同生命的轮回：不由人意地出生，持续获得各种荣誉，在过去的十年中开始颜面尽失、
不可逆转的颓势。这不是说再也不会有令人称赏的新影片出现，但佳片的出现只不过是例外情况。任何
艺术中的伟大成就莫不如此。这种佳片必须大胆地打破现在以及将来的资本主义世界也就是说在整个世
界中束缚电影制作的一切经验和常规。而普通影片，纯粹的娱乐片（即商业片）将保持其惊人的弱智：
大多数媚俗影片已彻底失败，它们不再能吸引挑剔的目标观众。如今佳片的重要特征（比任何时候都突
出）就是独树一帜，而商业片却采取了过度膨胀、墨守成规的制片方式，无所顾忌地组合或再组合，以
图再现昨日的辉煌。每一部希冀尽可能吸引更多观众的影片无不是某种仿效或重拍。电影曾被誉为二十
世纪的艺术，而今天面临二十世纪将尽之际，电影似乎也成了一种没落的艺术。

也许没落的不是电影，而只是人们的电影迷恋（cinephila），这个词特指电影所激发的某种爱。每一
种艺术都会吸引一批迷恋者。电影所激发的爱曾十分博大，因为人们一开始就确信电影不同于其他任何
一门艺术：它具有典型的现代性；为人所喜闻乐见；诗情与神秘感、色情与道德存于一体。电影有门徒
追随（如同宗教）。电影是一场圣战。电影是一种世界观。喜爱诗歌、歌剧和舞蹈的人心中不仅仅只有
诗歌、歌剧或舞蹈，但影迷会认为电影是他们的惟一。电影包容一切——他们的确做到了这一点。电影
既是艺术，也是生活。

许多人注意到，一百年前电影的诞生是双重的开端。在1895年，电影诞生的第一年，制作出两类影片，
发展成电影的两种模式：一种是再现非舞台的真实生活的电影（卢米埃尔兄弟的制作），一种是作为创
作、技艺、幻觉、梦想的电影（梅利耶的作品）。但这两者从来也不是完全对立的。对于那些初次观看
卢米埃尔兄弟所拍的《火车进入拉西奥塔站》的观众，电影所再现的单调场景是奇妙的经历。电影的诞
生是个奇迹，奇在现实竟能如此奇妙地瞬间再现。电影的全部就是在努力使这种神奇感永存和再生。

一切都开始于一百年前火车进站的那个瞬间。当人们兴奋地叫喊，甚至火车朝他们开来时起身躲避，这
时他们就已经接受了电影。在电影院被电视掏空之前，我们是从每周一次的电影中学会了昂首阔步、吸
烟、接吻、打架和痛不欲生。电影教你如何增加个人魅力，如……即使不下雨，穿雨衣也会更帅气。但
你所学到的只不过是在模仿他人之中迷失自己——在电视欣赏中体现了你更多的欲望。最强烈的体验则
是完全被银幕征服和感染。你情愿做电影的俘虏。

被俘虏的前提条件是被电影画面所征服。而“看电影”的环境场所为获得这种体验提供了保证。在电视
上看一部大片算不上是看过这部影片。（对于专为电视拍摄的影片也是如此，如法斯宾德的《柏林亚历
山大广场》和埃德加·赖茨的两部故乡影片）屏幕尺寸相差悬殊：影院中超级的大于真人的实景画面不
同于家里电视匣子的小影像。更为重要的是，在家庭氛围中看电影无法聚精会神，这种环境是对电影极
端的不尊重。由于银幕不再有标准的尺寸，在家里放电影可以和客厅或卧室的墙壁一样大，但你仍然是
在客厅或卧室里，不管是独自一人还是有亲友陪伴。要被征服，就必须到电影院去，在黑暗中和陌生人
坐在一起。

再多的哀思也无法使黑暗的影院中逝去的仪式——引起性欲的、沉默的——复活。电影退化成武斗场，
为达到吸引观众注意力的目的，画面剪辑毫无规则（速度越来越快），使得电影成为不值得任何人去全
身心关注的无足轻重的东西。电影画面现在可以以任何尺寸放映到各种平面上：影院中的银幕，小如手
掌或大到整面墙壁的家庭屏幕，迪斯科舞厅的墙壁或体育场的超大屏幕，以及大型公共建筑的外墙。无
处不在的移动画面逐步伤害了人们曾经拥有的电影标准，不管是作为严肃艺术，还是作为大众娱乐方式。

在电影出现的早期，基本上没有艺术片和娱乐片的区分。在无声时代，所有的影片，从路易·菲亚德、
D.W.格里菲斯、狄加·维尔托夫、帕布斯特、茂瑙、金·维多的代表作到俗套的情节剧和喜剧，都比后
来大多数的影片好。有声时代到来之后，画面的制作失却了原有的诗情画意，商业标准严格了。这一制
片模式——好莱坞体系——主导制片业达二十五年（约1930-1955年）。最富有创新精神的导演，如埃
里希·冯·斯特劳亨和奥森·威尔斯被这一体制击败，过低的预算最终使他们在欧洲遭艺术流放——欧
洲也或多或少奉行同样的损害影片质量的体制。在这一时期，只有法国制作出数量不菲的佳片。在二十
世纪五十年代中期，开拓创新意识又一次占据上风，其根源在于战后意大利电影所倡导的电影即是工艺
的思想。一批由新人主演，小班底拍摄的富有激情的原创严肃片参加电影节（这种电影节越来越多），
并在荣膺大奖后走入世界影院。这一电影的黄金时代持续了二十年。

在百年电影史中的这一特定时刻，看电影、想电影、谈电影成为大学生和其他青年人的时尚。人们不仅
爱剧中演员，还会爱电影本身。对电影的迷恋于二十世纪五十年代初现于法国：其园地为声名远播的电
影杂志《电影手册》（德、意、英、瑞典、美、加等国也相继出版了类似的热销杂志）。随着电影在欧
美的风靡，各种专事经典影片回顾展播的文献影片馆和电影俱乐部成为电影的圣殿。二十世纪六十年代
和七十年代早期是电影的理想年代，全职影迷终日渴盼在离银幕尽可能近的地方找到座位，最理想的位
置在第三排正中。“没有罗西尼亚就无法生活”，贝托鲁奇《革命前》（1964）中的人物如是说——那
时的情形确实如此。

> 电影迷恋多发于西欧——不管是对戈达尔和特吕弗及贝托鲁奇和西贝尔贝格早期的电影引发的欢乐，还是近年南尼·莫雷蒂影片中阴郁的悲伤。“另一个欧洲”的大导演（波兰的扎努西、希腊的安格罗普洛斯、俄罗斯的塔可夫斯基和苏可洛夫、匈牙利的扬乔和塔尔）和日本的大导演（小津安二郎、沟口健二、黑泽明、成濑巳喜男、大岛渚、今村昌平）并非影迷，可能由于在布达佩斯、莫斯科、东京、华沙或雅典他们未受到电影馆的熏陶。影迷口味的独特之处在于它既爱“艺术”片，也爱通俗片。因此，处于艺术极点的欧洲影迷会痴迷于某些好莱坞导演的电影：戈达尔喜爱霍华德·霍克斯，法斯宾德喜爱道格拉斯·西尔克。当然，电影迷恋产生的时刻也是好莱坞制片衰落之时，电影业似乎又重新获得了实验的权利；怀旧的影迷能去看那些好莱坞流派的经典老片。一群新人闯入电影界，包括来自《电影手册》的年轻一代的影评人士：那一代人中，实际上电影界几十年中最伟大的人物是让-吕克·戈达尔。有几位作家成为才能卓越的制片人：德国的亚历山大·克鲁格，意大利的皮尔·保罗·帕索里尼。（作家投笔从影的现象实际上此前出现在法国，二十世纪三十年代的帕尼奥尔和四十年代的科克托；但直到六十年代这在欧洲才成为寻常事。）电影似乎获得了新生。

在大约十五年的时间里，杰作大量涌现，人们不免猜想这种景象会永远持续下去。诚然，在电影产业性
和艺术性之间及沿袭常规和实验创新之间始终存在着冲突。但这一冲突并未遏止佳片的产生，佳片有时
出自主流电影，有时出自非主流电影。现在天平绝对地倾向了以电影为产业的一方。六十年代和七十年
代的巨片无不遭冷遇。自七十年代始，好莱坞就在平庸地模仿成功的欧洲新片的剪辑以及不断向边缘化
的美国独立影片的叙事手法的创新之处。随之在八十年代，制片成本上升到灾难性的高度，全球范围内
被迫实行制片和发行的新产业标准。其结果可以从过去数十年中的一些大导演的凄惨命运上看出。像汉
斯·尤尔根·西贝尔贝格这样一位独树一帜的导演，如今完全退出了电影制作，而伟大的戈达尔现在拍
摄的是一些关于电影历史的录像片，电影哪里还有他们的位置呢？再看看其他几个例子。在辉煌而悲剧
性的短暂电影生涯中，资金和演员的国际化给安德烈·塔可夫斯基的最后两部影片带来灾难性的打击，
这种制片环境也同样给两位仍在工作的最有价值导演的艺术带来灾难：他们是克里斯多夫·扎努西（《
晶体的结构》、《灵性之光》、《盘旋》、《契约》）和特奥·安格罗普洛斯（《重建》、《1936年的
一天》、《流浪艺人》）。而现在的贝拉·塔尔（《入地狱》、《恶魔的探戈》）将会怎样呢？在俄罗
斯残酷的资本主义环境下，亚历山大·苏可洛夫（《生存和抵抗》、《日食》、《第二圈》、《石》、
《耳语专页》）如何才能筹得资金去拍摄他高贵典雅的影片呢？

对电影的热爱无疑已经降温。人们仍然喜欢去看电影，有人仍然钟爱电影，期待从一部影片中获得那种
特有的、不可或缺的东西。佳片仍然不时产生：迈克·利·的《裸露》，詹尼·阿梅利奥的《联社阿美
利加》，侯孝贤的《南国再见，南国》，阿巴斯·基阿鲁斯达米的《特写》和科克的三部曲。但是，人
们至少在青年人当中已很难发现那种对电影特有的迷恋，这种迷恋不仅仅是喜欢，而是一种对电影的审
美品位（建立在大量观看和重温电影辉煌历史的基础之上）。迷恋电影本身亦受责难，被认为是古怪、
陈旧和故作高深的行为。因为迷恋电影的前提是这些电影的独特而不可再现的奇异体验。在高度产业化
的时代，电影迷恋是没有地位的。由于对电影的情感变得宽泛和繁杂，不可避免地将电影变成了诗人吟
咏之物，也不可避免地吸引画家和作家等非电影业人士去拍电影。恰恰是这种思想必须首先被破除。这
种思想已经被破除了。

如果电影迷恋死亡了，电影也就死亡了——无论还会拍出多少影片，甚至是很好的片子。要想电影能够
复活，首先必须有一种新的电影迷恋出现。
