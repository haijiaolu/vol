Havel's New Year's Address to the Nation, 1990

My dear fellow citizens,

For forty years you heard from my predecessors on this day different
variations on the same theme: how our country was flourishing, how
many million tons of steel we produced, how happy we all were, how we
trusted our government, and what bright perspectives were unfolding in
front of us. I assume you did not propose me for this office so that I, 
too, would lie to you.

Our country is not flourishing. The enormous creative and spiritual
potential of our nations is not being used sensibly. Entire branches of
industry are producing goods that are of no interest to anyone, while we
are lacking the things we need. A state which calls itself a workers' state
humiliates and exploits workers. Our obsolete economy is wasting the
little energy we have available. A country that once could be proud of the
educational level of its citizens spends so little on education that it ranks
today as seventy-second in the world. We have polluted the soil, rivers
and forests bequeathed to us by our ancestors, and we have today the
most contaminated environment in Europe. Adults in our country die
earlier than in most other European countries.

Allow me a small personal observation. When I flew recently to Bratislava,
I found some time during discussions to look out of the plane window. I
saw the industrial complex of Slovnaft chemical factory and the giant
Petržalka housing estate right behind it. The view was enough for me to
understand that for decades our statesmen and political leaders did not
look or did not want to look out of the windows of their planes. No study
of statistics available to me would enable me to understand faster and
better the situation in which we find ourselves.

But all this is still not the main problem. The worst thing is that we live in
a contaminated moral environment. We fell morally ill because we became
used to saying something different from what we thought. We learned not
to believe in anything, to ignore one another, to care only about
ourselves. Concepts such as love, friendship, compassion, humility or
forgiveness lost their depth and dimension, and for many of us they
represented only psychological peculiarities, or they resembled goneastray 
greetings from ancient times, a little ridiculous in the era of
computers and spaceships. Only a few of us were able to cry out loudly
that the powers that be should not be all-powerful and that the special
farms, which produced ecologically pure and top-quality food just for
them, should send their produce to schools, children's homes and
hospitals if our agriculture was unable to offer them to all.

The previous regime - armed with its arrogant and intolerant ideology -
reduced man to a force of production, and nature to a tool of production.
In this it attacked both their very substance and their mutual relationship.
It reduced gifted and autonomous people, skillfully working in their own
country, to the nuts and bolts of some monstrously huge, noisy and
stinking machine, whose real meaning was not clear to anyone. It could
not do more than slowly but inexorably wear out itself and all its nuts and
bolts.

When I talk about the contaminated moral atmosphere, I am not talking
just about the gentlemen who eat organic vegetables and do not look out
of the plane windows. I am talking about all of us. We had all become
used to the totalitarian system and accepted it as an unchangeable fact
and thus helped to perpetuate it. In other words, we are all - though
naturally to differing extents - responsible for the operation of the
totalitarian machinery. None of us is just its victim. 
We are all also its cocreators.

Why do I say this? It would be very unreasonable to understand the sad
legacy of the last forty years as something alien, which some distant
relative bequeathed to us. On the contrary, we have to accept this legacy
as a sin we committed against ourselves. If we accept it as such, we will
understand that it is up to us all, and up to us alone to do something
about it. We cannot blame the previous rulers for everything, not only
because it would be untrue, but also because it would blunt the duty that
each of us faces today: namely, the obligation to act independently,
freely, reasonably and quickly. Let us not be mistaken: the best
government in the world, the best parliament and the best president,
cannot achieve much on their own. And it would be wrong to expect a
general remedy from them alone. Freedom and democracy include
participation and therefore responsibility from us all.

If we realize this, then all the horrors that the new Czechoslovak
democracy inherited will cease to appear so terrible. If we realize this,
hope will return to our hearts.

In the effort to rectify matters of common concern, we have something to
lean on. The recent period - and in particular the last six weeks of our
peaceful revolution - has shown the enormous human, moral and
spiritual potential, and the civic culture that slumbered in our society
under the enforced mask of apathy. Whenever someone categorically
claimed that we were this or that, I always objected that society is a very
mysterious creature and that it is unwise to trust only the face it presents
to you. I am happy that I was not mistaken. Everywhere in the world
people wonder where those meek, humiliated, skeptical and seemingly
cynical citizens of Czechoslovakia found the marvelous strength to shake
the totalitarian yoke from their shoulders in several weeks, and in a
decent and peaceful way. And let us ask: Where did the young people
who never knew another system get their desire for truth, their love of
free thought, their political ideas, their civic courage and civic prudence?
How did it happen that their parents -- the very generation that had been
considered lost -- joined them? How is it that so many people
immediately knew what to do and none needed any advice or instruction?

I think there are two main reasons for the hopeful face of our present
situation. First of all, people are never just a product of the external
world; they are also able to relate themselves to something superior,
however systematically the external world tries to kill that ability in them.
Secondly, the humanistic and democratic traditions, about which there
had been so much idle talk, did after all slumber in the unconsciousness
of our nations and ethnic minorities, and were inconspicuously passed
from one generation to another, so that each of us could discover them
at the right time and transform them into deeds.

We had to pay, however, for our present freedom. Many citizens perished
in jails in the 1950s, many were executed, thousands of human lives were
destroyed, hundreds of thousands of talented people were forced to leave
the country. Those who defended the honor of our nations during the
Second World War, those who rebelled against totalitarian rule and those
who simply managed to remain themselves and think freely, were all
persecuted. We should not forget any of those who paid for our present
freedom in one way or another. Independent courts should impartially
consider the possible guilt of those who were responsible for the
persecutions, so that the truth about our recent past might be fully
revealed.

We must also bear in mind that other nations have paid even more dearly
for their present freedom, and that indirectly they have also paid for ours.
The rivers of blood that have flowed in Hungary, Poland, Germany and
recently in such a horrific manner in Romania, as well as the sea of blood
shed by the nations of the Soviet Union, must not be forgotten. First of all
because all human suffering concerns every other human being. But more
than this, they must also not be forgotten because it is these great
sacrifices that form the tragic background of today's freedom or the
gradual emancipation of the nations of the Soviet Bloc, and thus the
background of our own newfound freedom. Without the changes in the
Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary, and the German Democratic Republic,
what has happened in our country would have scarcely happened. And if
it did, it certainly would not have followed such a peaceful course.

The fact that we enjoyed optimal international conditions does not mean
that anyone else has directly helped us during the recent weeks. In fact,
after hundreds of years, both our nations have raised their heads high of
their own initiative without relying on the help of stronger nations or
powers. It seems to me that this constitutes the great moral asset of the
present moment. This moment holds within itself the hope that in the
future we will no longer suffer from the complex of those who must
always express their gratitude to somebody. It now depends only on us
whether this hope will be realized and whether our civic, national, and
political self-confidence will be awakened in a historically new way.

Self-confidence is not pride. Just the contrary: only a person or a nation
that is self-confident, in the best sense of the word, is capable of
listening to others, accepting them as equals, forgiving its enemies and
regretting its own guilt. Let us try to introduce this kind of
self-confidence into the life of our community and, as nations, into our
behavior on the international stage. Only thus can we restore our
self-respect and our respect for one another as well as the respect of other
nations.

Our state should never again be an appendage or a poor relative of
anyone else. It is true that we must accept and learn many things from
others, but we must do this in the future as their equal partners, who also
have something to offer.

Our first president wrote: "Jesus, not Caesar." In this he followed our
philosophers Chelick and Komensk. I dare to say that we may even have
an opportunity to spread this idea further and introduce a new element
into European and global politics. Our country, if that is what we want,
can now permanently radiate love, understanding, the power of the spirit
and of ideas. It is precisely this glow that we can offer as our specific
contribution to international politics.

Masaryk based his politics on morality. Let us try, in a new time and in a
new way, to restore this concept of politics. Let us teach ourselves and
others that politics should be an expression of a desire to contribute to
the happiness of the community rather than of a need to cheat or rape
the community. Let us teach ourselves and others that politics can be not
simply the art of the possible, especially if this means the art of
speculation, calculation, intrigue, secret deals and pragmatic
maneuvering, but that it can also be the art of the impossible, that is, the
art of improving ourselves and the world.

We are a small country, yet at one time we were the spiritual crossroads
of Europe. Is there a reason why we could not again become one? Would
it not be another asset with which to repay the help of others that we are
going to need?

Our homegrown Mafia, those who do not look out of the plane windows
and who eat specially fed pigs, may still be around and at times may
muddy the waters, but they are no longer our main enemy. Even less so is
our main enemy any kind of international Mafia. Our main enemy today is
our own bad traits: indifference to the common good, vanity, personal
ambition, selfishness, and rivalry. The main struggle will have to be
fought on this field.

There are free elections and an election campaign ahead of us. Let us not
allow this struggle to dirty the so-far clean face of our gentle revolution.
Let us not allow the sympathies of the world, which we have won so fast,
to be equally rapidly lost through our becoming entangled in the jungle
of skirmishes for power. Let us not allow the desire to serve oneself to
bloom once again under the stately garb of the desire to serve the
common good. It is not really important now which party, club or group
prevails in the elections. The important thing is that the winners will be
the best of us, in the moral, civic, political and professional sense,
regardless of their political affiliations. The future policies and prestige of
our state will depend on the personalities we select, and later, elect to
our representative bodies.

My dear fellow citizens!

Three days ago I became the president of the republic as a consequence
of your will, expressed through the deputies of the Federal Assembly.
You have a right to expect me to mention the tasks I see before me as
president.

The first of these is to use all my power and influence to ensure that we
soon step up to the ballot boxes in a free election, and that our path
toward this historic milestone will be dignified and peaceful.

My second task is to guarantee that we approach these elections as two
self-governing nations who respect each other's interests, national
identity, religious traditions, and symbols. As a Czech who has given his
presidential oath to an important Slovak who is personally close to him, I
feel a special obligation -- after the bitter experiences that Slovaks had in
the past -- to see that all the interests of the Slovak nation are respected
and that no state office, including the highest one, will ever be barred to
it in the future.

My third task is to support everything that will lead to better
circumstances for our children, the elderly, women, the sick, the
hardworking laborers, the national minorities and all citizens who are for
any reason worse off than others. High-quality food or hospitals must no
longer be a prerogative of the powerful; they must be available to those
who need them the most.

As supreme commander of the armed forces I want to guarantee that the
defensive capability of our country will no longer be used as a pretext for
anyone to stand in the way of courageous peace initiatives, the reduction
of military service, the establishment of alternative military service and
the overall humanization of military life.

In our country there are many prisoners who, though they may have
committed serious crimes and have been punished for them, have had to
submit -- despite the goodwill of some investigators, judges and above
all defense lawyers -- to a debased judiciary process that curtailed their
rights. They now have to live in prisons that do not strive to awaken the
better qualities contained in every person, but rather humiliate them and
destroy them physically and mentally. In a view of this fact, I have
decided to declare a relatively extensive amnesty. At the same time I call
on the prisoners to understand that forty years of unjust investigations,
trials and imprisonments cannot be put right overnight, and to
understand that the changes that are being speedily prepared still require
time to implement. By rebelling, the prisoners would help neither society
nor themselves. I also call on the public not to fear the prisoners once
they are released, not to make their lives difficult, to help them, in the
Christian spirit, after their return among us to find within themselves that
which jails could not find in them: the capacity to repent and the desire to
live a respectable life.

My honorable task is to strengthen the authority of our country in the
world. I would be glad if other states respected us for showing
understanding, tolerance and love for peace. I would be happy if Pope
John Paul II and the Dalai Lama of Tibet could visit our country before the
elections, if only for a day. I would be happy if our friendly relations with
all nations were strengthened. I would be happy if we succeeded before
the elections in establishing diplomatic relations with the Vatican and
Israel. I would also like to contribute to peace by briefly visiting our close
neighbors, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of
Germany. Neither shall I forget our other neighbors -- fraternal Poland
and the ever-closer countries of Hungary and Austria.

In conclusion, I would like to say that I want to be a president who will
speak less and work more. To be a president who will not only look out of
the windows of his airplane but who, first and foremost, will always be
present among his fellow citizens and listen to them well.

You may ask what kind of republic I dream of. Let me reply: I dream of a
republic independent, free, and democratic, of a republic economically
prosperous and yet socially just; in short, of a humane republic that
serves the individual and that therefore holds the hope that the individual
will serve it in turn. Of a republic of well-rounded people, because
without such people it is impossible to solve any of our problems --
human, economic, ecological, social, or political.

The most distinguished of my predecessors opened his first speech with
a quotation from the great Czech educator Komensk. Allow me to
conclude my first speech with my own paraphrase of the same statement:
People, your government has returned to you!

**1990 年新年献辞**  
瓦茨拉夫·哈维尔

亲爱的同胞们：

40 年来每逢今天，你们都从我的前任那里听到同一个主题的不同变化：有关我们的国家多么繁荣，我们生产了多少百万吨的钢，我们现在是多么幸福，我们如何信任我们的政府，以及我们面临的前途多么辉煌灿烂。我相信你们让我担当此职，并不是要我将这样的谎言向你们重复。

我们的国家并不繁荣。我们民族巨大的创造力和精神潜能并没有得到有效的发挥。整个工业部门生产着人们不感兴趣的东西，而我们所需要的东西却十分匮乏。一个自称属于劳动人民的国家，却贬损和剥削劳动者。我们陈腐的经济制度正在浪费我们可能有的一点能源。一个曾经以其公民的教育水准高而自豪的国家现在却因教育投资过少而降到了世界的第七十二位。我们污染了祖先馈赠给我们的土地、河流、森林，其破坏的程度在欧洲是最为严重的。我们国家成年人的死亡比大多数别的欧洲国家都来得更早。

请允许我提供一点个人的观察。最近我去布拉迪斯拉发，在飞机上我抽点时间从窗口往外看。我看见斯洛伐那夫化工联合企业和紧挨着它的巨大的柏特索加住宅区。这幅情景足以令我明白，数十年内我们国家的领导人从来没有也不打算从他们乘坐的飞机窗口往外看一眼。缘此，甚至并不需要统计数据，我也能更快更深地明白我们已经陷入一个怎样的境地。

但是所有这些还不是主要的问题。最糟的是我们生活在一个道德上被污染的环境之中。我们都是道德上的病人，因为我们习惯于口是心非。我们学会了不去相信任何东西，学会了互相否定及仅仅关注自己。这样一些概念如爱、友谊、怜悯、谦卑或宽恕失去了它们的深度和尺度，对许多人来说，们们仅仅代表了心理学意义上的怪癖，或相当于来自古代的早已过时的祝辞，在电脑和太空时代显得非常滑稽。我们当中很少有人大声喊出，有权者并不是无所不能的；并且那些生产没有污染和高质量食品的特殊农场，应将其产品送到学校、有孩子的家庭和医院，如果我们的农业不能向所有的人提供这些东西的话。

我们的前政权，以其狂妄自和偏狭的意识形态，将人缩减成一种生产力和相当于一个生产工具。这样做极大地伤害了他们的本来面貌和他们的互相关系。它将那些有才华和有自主性的人们，在自己的土地上熟练地工作的人们，驱逐至某些巨大畸型、嘈杂、有刺鼻臭味的机器旁边，沦为其齿轮和螺丝钉。这无非是慢慢地但却无情地磨损这个政权本身和其全部齿轮和螺丝钉。

当我谈及我们被污染的道德氛围时，我并不仅仅涉及那些吃不受污染的蔬菜和不从窗户外看一眼的人士。我说的是我们全体。我们都变得习惯于极权主义制度，将其作为一个不可更改的事实来加以接受，因而帮助了它，令其永存。换句话来说，我们所有的人——当然是在不同程度上——得为这个极权主义机器的运行承担责任；我们当中没有人仅仅是牺牲品，我们也都是它的共谋者。

我为什么说这些？ 如果把前四十年留下来的不幸遗产理解为与我们自己毫不相干的某件东西，那是非常不明智的，相反，我们必须承认这项遗产是我们对自己所犯下的一桩罪过。如果我们接受这样的解释，那么我们就能明白该由我们每一个人来为此做点什么。我们不能将每件事都归咎于前统治者，不仅是因为这样做不真实，而且也会削弱今天我们每个人所要面对的责任，即主动地、自由地、理性地、迅速地采取行动。让我们不要受此蒙蔽：即使是世界上最好的政府、国会和总统，都不可能单靠他们的力量获得成功。同样不能指望仅仅是这些人能挽救天下。自由和民主包含参与，因而是所有人的责任。

如果我们意识到这一点，那么，所有由新的捷克斯洛伐克社会所继承的可怕事物便显得不那么可怕。因此，希望也会回到我们的心里。

我们已经作出了可观的调整，具备了一定的基础。最近一个时期——尤其是过去六周的和平革命——已经表明， 在我们迫于环境不得不带上的冷漠面具背后，存在着巨大的、富有人性和道德力量的精神潜能和公民水准。每当有人武断地声称我们将会这样或那样时，我总是提出社会是一个十分微妙的存在，仅仅相信出现在你面前的东西是远远不够的。我很高兴我这话并没有说错。的确，这些逆来顺受的、饱受羞辱的、怀疑主义的和近乎犬马主义的捷克斯洛伐克公民找到了那种巨大的力量，在数周之内，以文明和平的方式，摆脱了自己身上的极权主义枷锁，令世人瞩目和称奇。我们也不妨反问自己：从来没有在另外一种制度下生活过的青年人，是从什么地方开始对真实的追求、对自由思想的热爱、拥有政治上的理想和公民的勇气及眼光呢？ 他们的父母——被认为是迷失的一代——是如何和他们的孩子走到一起的呢？ 怎么会有那么多人在不需要任何建议或指示的情况下，立刻领略到去做什么呢？

我想我们目前的处境中富有希望的这一面有两个主要原因：首先，人决不仅仅是这个实际世界的产物，而是能够将自身与某种更高的东西联系起来，尽管这个实际世界试图一步步扼杀人们的这种能力；第二，我们民族的人道主义和民主的传统（人们常常空洞地谈论它们），仍然沉睡在人们意识深处；难以察觉地从上一代传至下一代，这使得我们每个人能及时地发现它们并将之转变为行动。

然而，我们也不得不为今天的自由付出代价。许多人于 1950 年代死于狱中，不少人遭枪决；上千上百的人们的生活遭到破坏，大量有才华的人被迫离开了这个国家。那些在第二次世界大战中献身于民族荣誉的人，那些反抗极权主义的统治惨遭迫害的人，那些仅仅想保持自己本来面貌和自由地思想却蒙受不幸的人们，我们应当记取它们，记取它们以这样那样的方式为今天的自己所付出的代价。自主的法庭应当不受干扰地审查对种种迫害负有责任的人，使我们的过去真相大白。

我们也应牢记其他的民族为其目前的自由付出的甚至是更昂贵的代价，其实也是间接地为我们所付出的。在匈牙利、波兰、东德曾血流成河，不久前在罗马尼亚又发生了这种可怕的情况。同样，苏联境内的各民族也曾抛洒热血，这些都不能忘记。首先每一个人类成员的受苦和其他人类成员相关联；更重要的是，这些巨大的牺牲构成了今天的自由的悲剧背景，也带来了苏联阵营内部各民族的逐步解放。它们也构成了我们自己新建立的自由的背景：没有苏联、波兰、匈牙利和东德的变化，我们国家的情况也不会像这样。抑或即使改变，也不会拥有如此一个和平的进程。

我们享有有利的国际环境，这是事实，但并不是说在最近几周之内有人直接给我们提供援助。几百年来，捷克和斯洛伐克民族始终依靠自己，而不是依赖强国和强权的援助。在我看来，这构成了我们目前巨大的宝贵财富。其中包括了这样的希望，今后我们可以免于因受人恩惠带来的麻烦。现在依靠我们自身这个希望能否实现，我们公民的、民族的、政治上的自信能否以一个新的历史姿态复苏，全看我们的努力了。

自信并不是自负。恰恰相反，只有真正自信的人或民族，才能倾听别人，平等地接受他人，宽恕其敌人和为自己的罪过感到悔恨。让我们把这种自信带进我们的共同的社会生活之中，带到我们的国际舞台上的行为方式之中。只有这样我们才能恢复自尊，恢复对于他人的尊敬和对其他民族的尊敬。

我们的国家将永远不再成为一个附属国或与其他国家关系恶化。的确，我们必须从别国那里接受和学习许多东西，但这必须是平等互助的那种关系。我们第一任总统写道：“要耶稣，不要凯撒。”这是继承了我们的哲学家赫尔斯基(Chelcicky)和科明纽斯(Comenius)的传统。我说我们现在正有一个机会将这个思想发扬光大，并将其作为一个新的因素引进至欧洲和全球政治之中。如果这是我们所需要的话，我们国家正可以持久地令仁爱、理解、精神及理想力量得以焕发。这正是我们对国际政治所能作出的特殊的贡献。

马萨里克将政治建立道德的基础之上。让我们努力在一个崭新的时代和以一种崭新的方式重新恢复这个政治概念。让我们教导自己和教导别人，政治是人们表达为社会谋福利的要求，而不是对社会的欺骗或劫掠。让我们教导自己和教导别人，政治不仅仅是一门模棱两可的艺术，它更可能是一门坚持原则的艺术，一门改进世界和我们自身的艺术。

我们是一个小国家，但曾经是欧洲精神文化重镇。为什么我们不可以再恢复到从前？如果我们还需要别人的帮助，这难道不是最好的回报吗？

那些从前危害我们的人——不往飞机的窗户外张望一眼和吃特殊供应的人们——也许仍在周围并制造污染，但他们不再是我们的主要敌人。那些国际上的危害力量也不是我们的主要敌人。今天我们的主要敌人是我们自已的恶习：漠视公德、空虚、个人野心、自私和互相倾轧。主要的斗争将不得不在这个领域中进行。

我们将举行自由选举和自由竞选活动。让我们不要使得这项活动给我们和平革命的洁净面貌抹黑。不要因为我们变得纠缠于权力纷争而马上失去刚刚赢得的国际社会的同情。不要再在服务于社会的虚假名义下行个人私利之实。其实，现在是哪个党派、团体赢得选举不是最重要的，最重要的是将我们当中在道德、公民意识、政治专业方面最优秀的人推举出来，而不论他们的政治背景。我们国家未来的政策和威望取决于我们选出什么样的人来和稍候选择的代议机构。

<!-- 【缺失的段落】 -->

亲爱的同胞们，

三天前，根据你们通过联邦议会代表表达的意愿，我成为共和国总统。 你们有权期望我提及我作为总统所面临的任务。

首先是利用我的全部权力和影响力，确保我们很快走上自由选举的投票箱，并确保我们迈向这一历史性里程碑的道路将是有尊严、和平的。

我的第二个任务是保证我们作为两个尊重彼此利益、民族认同、宗教传统和象征的自治国家来对待这些选举。 作为一名向一位与他关系密切的重要斯洛伐克人宣誓就任总统的捷克人，在经历了斯洛伐克人过去的痛苦经历之后，我感到自己有一种特殊的义务，即确保斯洛伐克民族的所有利益都得到尊重，并且不让斯洛伐克人的利益受到侵犯。 国家办公室，包括最高的办公室，今后将永远被禁止。

我的第三个任务是支持一切能够为我们的儿童、老人、妇女、病人、勤劳的劳动者、少数民族和所有因任何原因比其他人处境更糟的公民创造更好环境的事情。 高质量的食品或医院绝不能再是强者的特权； 它们必须提供给最需要它们的人。

作为武装部队最高统帅，我要保证，我国的防御能力将不再成为任何人阻碍勇敢和平倡议、减少兵役、建立替代兵役和全面人性化的借口。 的军事生活。

在我国，有许多囚犯，尽管他们可能犯有严重罪行并因此受到惩罚，但不得不服从——尽管一些调查人员、法官，尤其是辩护律师的善意——受到贬低的司法程序的限制，从而限制了他们的权利。 他们现在不得不生活在监狱里，这些监狱不努力唤醒每个人所拥有的更好的品质，而是羞辱他们并摧毁他们的身心。 鉴于这一事实，我决定宣布一项相对广泛的大赦。 同时，我呼吁囚犯们明白，四十年来的不公正调查、审判和监禁不可能一蹴而就，并且要明白，正在迅速准备的改变仍然需要时间来实施。 囚犯的反抗对社会和他们自己都没有帮助。 我还呼吁公众，一旦囚犯被释放，不要害怕他们，不要让他们的生活变得困难，要本着基督教的精神，在他们回到我们中间后，帮助他们找到监狱在他们身上找不到的东西：有能力 悔改并渴望过上受人尊敬的生活。

我的光荣任务是加强我国在世界上的权威。 如果其他国家尊重我们表现出的理解、宽容和对和平的热爱，我会很高兴。 如果教皇约翰·保罗二世和西藏达赖喇嘛能够在选举前访问我国，哪怕只是一天，我都会很高兴。 如果我们与所有国家的友好关系得到加强，我会很高兴。 如果我们在选举前成功与梵蒂冈和以色列建立外交关系，我会很高兴。 我还想通过短暂访问我们的近邻德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国来为和平做出贡献。 我也不会忘记我们的其他邻国——兄弟的波兰以及日益亲密的国家匈牙利和奥地利。

<!-- 【缺失的段落】 -->

总之，我希望自己是一名少空谈多做实事的人。不仅要从我乘坐的飞机窗户上朝外看，而且首先并且更重要的是经常出现在你们当中并耐心地倾听你们的声音。

人们也许会询问我所梦想的共和国到底是什么面貌。请允许我回答：我梦想的是一个独立、自信、民主、拥有繁荣的经济和社会公正的共和国，简言之，是服务于个人并因此希望个人也来为其服务的富有人性的共和国。在这个共和国内，人们都受过完整的、良好的教育。要想解决人为的、经济的、环境的或政治方面的任何问题，一定要有具有优秀素质的人。

我的最杰出的前任马萨里克以伟大的捷克教育家科明纽斯的一句话来作为他第一次讲演的开头。请允许我借用这句话并辅之以我自己的语言来结束我的第一次演讲：人民，你们的政府还给你们了!

1990 年 1 月
