ADDRESS OF H. A. ROWLANd OF BALTIMORE, MD.,
VICE-PRESIDENT OF SECTION B, AUG. 15, 1883.

A PLEA FOR PURE SCIENCE.

> In using the word ' science,' I refer to physical science; as I
> know nothing of natural science. Probably my remarks will,
> however, apply to both, but I do not know.

The question is sometimes asked us as to the time
of year we like the best. To my mind, the spring is
the most delightful; for nature then recovers from
the apathy of winter, and stirs herself to renewed
life. The leaves grow, and the buds open, with a
suggestion of vigor delightful to behold; and we
revel in this ever-renewed life of nature. But this
cannot always last. The leaves reach their limit;
the buds open to the full, and pass away. Then we
begin to ask ourselves whether all this display has
been in vain, or whether it has led to a bountiful
harvest.

So this magnificent country of ours has rivalled the
vigor of spring in its growth. Forests have been
levelled, aud cities built, and a large and powerful
nation has been created on the face of the earth.
We are proud of our advancement. We are proud of
such cities as this, founded in a day upon a spot over
which, but a few years since, the red man hunted the
buffalo. But we must remember that this is only the
spring of our country. Our glance must not be backward;
for however beautiful leaves and blossoms are,
and however marvellous their rapid increase, they are
but leaves and blossoms after all. Rather should we
look forward to discover what will be the outcome of
all this, and what the chance of harvest. For if we
do this in time, we may discover the worm which
threatens the ripe fruit, or the barren spot where the
harvest is withering for want of water.

I am required to address the so-called physical
section of this association. Fain would I speak pleasant
words to you on this subject; fain would I recount
to you the progress made in this subject by my
countrymen, and their noble efforts to understand
the order of the universe. But I go out to gather
the grain ripe to the harvest, and I find only tares.
Here and there a noble head of grain rises above the
weeds; but so few are they, that I find the majority
of my countrymen know them not, but think that
they have a waving harvest, while it is only one of
weeds after all. American science is a thing of the
future, and not of the present or past; and the proper
course of one in my position is to consider what
must be done to create a science of physics in this
country, rather than to call telegraphs, electric lights,
and such conveniences, by the name of science. I do
not wish to underrate the value of all these things:
the progress of the world depends on them, and he is
to be honored who cultivates them successfully. So
also the cook who invents a new and palatable dish
for the table benefits the world to a certain degree;
yet we do not dignify him by the name of a
chemist. And yet it is not an uncommon thing,
especially in American newspapers, to have the applications
of science confounded with pure science;
and some obscure American who steals the ideas of
some great mind of the past, and enriches himself
by the application of the same to domestic uses, is
often lauded above the great originator of the idea,
who might have worked out hundreds of such applications,
had his mind possessed the necessary element
of vulgarity. I have often been asked, which
was the more important to the world, pure or applied
science. To have the applications of a science, the
science itself must exist. Should we stop its progress,
and attend only to its applications, we should
soon degenerate into a people like the Chinese, who
have made no progress for generations, because they
have been satisfied with the applications of science,
and have never sought for reasons in what they have
done. The reasons constitute pure science. They
have known the application of gunpowder for centuries;
and yet the reasons for its peculiar action, if
sought in the proper manner, would have developed
the science of chemistry, and even of physics, with
all their numerous applications. By contenting themselves
with the fact that gunpowder will explode,
and seeking no farther, they have fallen behind in
the progress of the world; and we now regard this
oldest and most numerous of nations as only barbarians.
And yet our own country is in this same
state. But we have done better; for we have taken
the science of the old world, and applied it to all our
uses, accepting it like the rain of heaven, without
asking whence it came, or even acknowledging the
debt of gratitude we owe to the great and unselfish
workers who have given it to us. And, like the rain
of heaven, this pure science has fallen upon our
country, and made it great and rich and strong.

To a civilized nation of the present day, the applications
of science are a necessity; and our country
has hitherto succeeded in this line, only for the reason
that there are certain countries in the world where
pure science has been and is cultivated, and where
the study of nature is considered a noble pursuit.
But such countries are rare, and those who wish to
pursue pure science in our own country must be
prepared to face public opinion in a manner which
requires much moral courage. They must be prepared
to be looked down upon by every successful inventor
whose shallow mind imagines that the only pursuit of
mankind is wealth, and that he who obtains most has
best succeeded in this world. Everybody can comprehend
a million of money; but how few can comprehend
any advance in scientific theory, especially
in its more abstruse portions! And this, I believe,
is one of the causes of the small number of persons
who have ever devoted themselves to work of the
higher order in any human pursuit. Man is a gregarious
animal, and depends very much, for his happiness,
on the sympathy of those around him; and it is
rare to find one with the courage to pursue his own
ideals in spite of his surroundings. In times past, men
were more isolated than at present, and each came in
contact with a fewer number of people. Hence that
time constitutes the period when the great sculptures,
paintings, and poems were produced. Each man's
mind was comparatively free to follow its own ideals,
and the results were the great and unique works of
the ancient masters. To-day the railroad and the
telegraph, the books and newspapers, have united
each individual man with the rest of the world: instead
of his mind being an individual, a thing apart
by itself, and unique, it has become so influenced by
the outer world, and so dependent upon it, that it
has lost its originality to a great extent. The man
who in times past would naturally have been in the
lowest depths of poverty, mentally and physically,
to-day measures tape behind a counter, and with
lordly air advises the naturally born genius how he
may best bring his outward appearance down to a
level with his own. A new idea he never had, but
he can at least cover his mental nakedness with ideas
imbibed from others. So the genius of the past soon
perceives that his higher ideas are too high to be
appreciated by the world: his mind is clipped down
to the standard form; every natural offshoot upwards
is repressed, until the man is no higher than his fellows.
Hence the world, through the abundance of
its intercourse, is reduced to a level. What was
formerly a grand and magnificent landscape, with
mountains ascending above the clouds, and depths
whose gloom we cannot now appreciate, has become
serene and peaceful. The depths have been filled,
and the heights levelled, and the wavy harvests and
smoky factories cover the landscape.

As far as the average man is concerned, the change
is for the better. The average life of man is far
pleasanter, and his mental condition better, than before.
But we miss the vigor imparted by the mountains.
We are tired of mediocrity, the curse of our
country. We are tired of seeing our artists reduced
to hirelings, and imploring congress to protect them
against foreign competition. We are tired of seeing
our countrymen take their science from abroad, and
boast that they here convert it into wealth. We are
tired of seeing our professors degrading their chairs
by the pursuit of applied science instead of pure
science; or sitting inactive while the whole world
is open to investigation; lingering by the wayside
while the problem of the universe remains unsolved.
We wish for something higher and nobler in this
country of mediocrity, for a mountain to relieve the
landscape of its monotony. We are surrounded with
mysteries, and have been created with minds to enjoy
and reason to aid in the unfolding of such mysteries.
Nature calls to us to study her, and our better feelings
urge us in the same direction.

For generations there have been some few students
of science who have esteemed the study of nature the
most noble of pursuits. Some have been wealthy,
and some poor; but they have all had one thing in
common, - the love of nature and its laws. To these
few men the world owes all the progress due to applied
science, and yet very few ever received any
payment in this world for their labors.

Faraday, the great discoverer of the principle on
which all machines for electric lighting, electric railways,
and the transmission of power, must rest, died
a poor man, although others and the whole world
have been enriched by his discoveries. And such
must be the fate of the followers in his footsteps for
some time to come.

But there will be those in the future who will study
nature from pure love, and for them higher prizes
than any yet obtained are waiting. We have but
yet commenced our pursuit of science, and stand
upon the threshold wondering what there is within.
We explain the motion of the planet by the law of
gravitation; but who will explain how two bodies,
millions of miles apart, tend to go toward each other
with a certain force?

We now weigh and measure electricity and electric
currents with as much ease as ordinary matter, yet
have we made an approach to an explanation of the
phenomenon of electricity? Light is an undulatory
motion, and yet do we know what it is that undulates?
Heat is motion, yet do we know what it is
that moves? Ordinary matter is a common substance,
and yet who shall fathom the mystery of its
internal constitution?

There is room for all in the work, and the race has
but commenced. The problems are not to be solved
in a moment, but need the best work of the best
minds, for an indefinite time.

Shall our country be contented to stand by, while
other countries lead in the race? Shall we always
grovel in the dust, and pick up the crumbs which
fall from the rich man's table, considering ourselves
richer than he because we have more crumbs, while
other countries lead in the race? Shall we always
grovel in the dust, and pick up the crumbs which
fall from the rich man's table, considering ourselves
richer than he because we have more crumbs, while
we forget that he has the cake, which is the source of
all crumbs? Shall we be swine, to whom the corn and
husks are of more value than the pearls? If I read
aright the signs of the times, I think we shall not
always be contented with our inferior position.
From looking down we have almost become blind,
but may recover. In a new country, the necessities
of life must be attended to first. The curse of Adam
is upon us all, and we must earn our bread.

But it is the mission of applied science to render
this easier for the whole world. There is a story
which I once read, which will illustrate the true position
of applied science in the world. A boy, more
fond of reading than of work, was employed, in the
early days of the steam-engine, to turn the valve at
every stroke. Necessity was the mother of invention
in his case: his reading was disturbed by his work,
and he soon discovered that he might become free
from his work by so tying the valve to some movable
portion of the engine, as to make it move its
own valve.
So I consider that the true pursuit of
mankind is intellectual. The scientific study of nature
in all its branches, of mathematics, of mankind
in its past and present, the pursuit of art, and the
cultivation of all that is great and noble in the world,
-- these are the highest occupation of mankind. Commerce,
the applications of science, the accumulation
of wealth, are necessities which are a curse to those
with high ideals, but a blessing to that portion of the
world which has neither the ability nor the taste for
higher pursuits.

As the applications of science multiply, living becomes
easier, the wealth necessary for the purchase
of apparatus can better be obtained, and the pursuit
of other things beside the necessities of life becomes
possible.

But the moral qualities must also be cultivated in
proportion to the wealth of the country, before much
can We done in pure science. The successful sculptor
or painter naturally attains to wealth through the legitimate
work of his profession. The novelist, the
poet, the musician, all have wealth before them as
the end of a successful career. But the scientist and
the mathematician have no such incentive to work:
they must earn their living by other pursuits, usually
teaching, and only devote their surplus time to the
true pursuit of their science. And frequently, by the
small salary which they receive, by the lack of instrumental
and literary facilities, by the mental
atmosphere in which they exist, and, most of all, by
their low ideals of life, they are led to devote their
surplus time to applied science or to other means of
increasing their fortune. How shall we, then, honor
the few, the very few, who, in spite of all difficulties,
have kept their eyes fixed on the goal, and have steadily
worked for pure science, giving to the world a most
precious donation, which has borne fruit in our
greater knowledge of the universe and in the applications
to our physical life which have enriched thou
sands and benefited each one of us? There are also
those who have every facility for the pursuit of science,
who have an ample salary and every appliance for
work, yet who devote themselves to commercial work,
to testifying in courts of law, and to any other work to
increase their present large income. Such men would
be respectable if they gave up the name of professor,
and took that of consulting chemists or physicists.
And such men are needed in the community. But
for a man to occupy the professor's chair in a prominent
college, and, by his evergy and ability in the
commercial applications of his science, stand before
the local community in a prominent manner, and become
the newspaper exponent of his science, is a disgrace
both to him and his college. It is the deathblow
to science in that region. Call him by his proper
name, aid he becomes at once a useful member of the
community. Put in his place a man who shall by
precept and example cultivate his science, and how
different is the result! Young men, looking forward
into the world for something to do, see before them
this high and noble life, and they see that there is
something more honorable than the accumulation of
wealth. They are thus led to devote their lives to
similar pursuits, and they honor the professor who las
drawn them to something higher than they might
otherwise have aspired to reach.

I do not wish to be misunderstood in this matter.
It is no disgrace to make money by an invention, or
otherwise, or to do commercial scientific work under
some circumstances. But let pure science be the aim
of those in the chairs of professors, and so prominently
the aim that there can be no mistake. If our aim in
life is wealth, let us honestly engage in commercial
pursuits, and compete with others for its possession.
But if we choose a life which we consider higher, let
us live up to it, taking wealth or poverty as it may
chance to come to us, but letting neither turn us
aside from our pursuit.

The work of teaching may absorb the energies of
many; and, indeed, this is the excuse given by most
for not doing any scientific work. But there is an old
saying, that where there is a will there is a way. Few
professors do as much teaching or lecturing as the
German professors, who are also noted for their elaborate
papers in the scientific journals. I myself
have been burdened down with work, and know what
it is; and yet I here assert that all can find time for
scientific research if they desire it. But here, again,
that curse of our country, mediocrity, is upon us.
Our colleges and universities seldom call for first-class
men of reputation, and I have even heard the trustee
of a well-known college assert that no professor should
engage in research because of the time wasted! I was
glad to see, soon after, by the call of a prominent scientist
to that college, that the majority of the trustees
did not agree with him.

That teaching is important, goes without saying. A
successful teacher is to be respected; but if he does
not lead his scholars to that which is highest, is he not
blameworthy? We are, then, to look to the colleges
and universities of the land for most of the work in
pure science which is done. Let us therefore examine
these latter, and see what the prospect is.

One, whom perhaps we may here style a practical
follower of Ruskin, has stated that while in this
country he was variously designated by the title of
captain, colonel, and professor. The story may or
may not be true, but we all know enough of the customs
of our countrymen not to dispute it on general
principles. All men are born equal: some men are
captains, colonels, and professors, and therefore all
men are such. The logic is conclusive; and the same
kind of logic seems to have been applied to our
schools, colleges, and universities. I have before me
the report of the commissioner of education for 1880.
According to that report, there were 389,[^1] or say, in
round numbers, 400 institutions, calling themselves
colleges or universities, in our country! We may
well exclaim that ours is a great country, having
more than the whole world beside. The fact is sufficient.
The whole earth would hardly support such
a number of first-class institutions. The curse of
mediocrity must be upon them, to swarm in such
numbers. They must be a cloud of mosquitoes, instead
of eagles as they profess. And this becomes
evident on further analysis. About one-third aspire
to the name of university; and I note one called by
that name which has two professors and 18 students,
and another having three teachers and 12 students!
And these instances are not unique, for the number
of small institutions and schools which call themselves
universities is very great. It is difficult to
decide from the statistics alone the exact standing
of these institutions. The extremes are easy to manage.
Who can doubt that an institution with over
800 students, and a faculty of 70, is of a higher grade
than those above cited having 10 or 20 students and
two or three in the faculty? Yet this is not always
true; for I note one institution with over 500 students
which is known to me personally as of the grade of
a high school. The statistics are more or less defective,
and it would much weaken the force of my
remarks if I went too much into detail. I append
the following tables, however, of 330 so-called colleges
and universities: --

```
218 had from   0  to 100 students.
 88   “    “ 100  “  200    “
 12   “    “ 200  “  300    “
  6   “    “ 300  “  500    “
  6 over     500
```

Of 322 so-called colleges and universities: --

```
206 had  0 to 10 in the faculty.
99  “   10 “  20     “     “
17  “   20 or over   “     “
```

If the statistics were forthcoming, -- and possibly
they may exist, -- we might also get an idea of the
standing of these institutions and their approach to
the true university idea, by the average age of the
scholars. Possibly also the ratio of number of scholars
to teachers might be of some help. All these methods
give an approximation to the present standing
of the institutions. But there is another method of
attacking the problem, which is very exact, but it only
gives us the possibilities of which the institution is
capable. I refer to the wealth of the institution. In
estimating the wealth, I have not included the value
of grounds and buildings, for this is of little importance,
either to the present or future standing of the
institution. As good work can be done in a hovel as
in a palace. I have taken the productive funds of
the institution as the basis of estimate. I find: --

```
234 have below    $500,000.
  8   “  between  $500,000 and $1,000,000.
  8   “  over     $1,000,000.
```

There is no fact more firmly established, all over the
world, than that the higher education can never be
made to pay for itself. Usually the cost. to a college,
of educating a young man, very much exceeds what
he pays for it, and is often three or four times as
much. The higher the education, the greater this
proportion will be; and a university of the highest
class should anticipate only a small accession to its
income from the fees of students. Hence the test
I have applied must give a true representation of
the possibilities in every case. According to the figures,
only 16 colleges and universities have $500,000
or over of invested funds, and only one-half of these
have $1,000,000 and over. Now, even the latter sum
is a very small endowment for a college; and to call
any institution a university which has less than.
$1,000,00, is to render it absurd in the face of the
world. And yet more than 100 of our institutions,
many of them very respectable colleges, have abused
the word university? in this manner. It is to be
hoped that the endowment of the more respectable
of these institutions may be increased, as many of
them deserve it; and their unfortunate appellation
has probably been repented of long since.

But what shall we think of a community that gives
the charter of a university to an institution with a
total of $20,000 endowment, two so-called professors,
and 18 students! or another with three professors,
12 students, and a total of $27,000 endowment, mostly
invested in buildings! And yet there are very many
similar institutions; there being 16 with three professors
or less, and very many indeed with only four
or five.

Such facts as these could only exist in a democratic
country, where pride is taken in reducing every thing
to a level. And I may also say, that it can only exist
in the early days of such a democracy; for an intelligent
public will soon perceive that calling a thing by
a wrong name does not change its character, and
that truth, above all things, should be taught to the
youth of the nation.

It may be urged, that all these institutions are
doing good work in education; and that many young
men are thus taught, who could not afford to go to a
true college or university. But I do not object to the
education, -though I have no doubt an investigation
would disclose equal absurdities here, - for it is
aside from my object. But I do object to lowering the
ideals of the youth of the country. Let them know
that they are attending a school, and not a university;
and let them know that above them comes the college,
and above that the university. Let them be taught
that they are only half-educated, and that there are
persons in the world by whose site they are but
atoms. In other words, let them be taught the truth.

It may be that some small institutions are of high
gradle, especially those which are new; but who can
doubt that more than two-thirds of our institutions
calling themselves colleges and universities are unworthy
of the name? Each one of these institutions
has so-called professors, but it is evident that they can
be only of the grade of teachers. Why should they not
be so called? The position of teacher is an honored
one, but is not made more honorable by the assumption
of a false title. Furthermore, the multiplication
of the title, and the ease with which it can be obtained,
render it scarcely worth striving for. When the man
of energy, ability, and perhaps genius is rewarded by
the same title and emoluments as the commonplace
man with the modicum of knowledge, who takes to
teaching, not because of any aptitude for his work,
but possibly because he has not the energy to compete
with his fellow-men in business, then I say one
of the inducements for first-class men to become
professors is gone.

When work and ability are required for the position,
and when the professor is expected to keep up with
the progress of his subject, and to do all in his power
to advance it, and when he is selected for these reasons,
then the position will be worth working for,
and the successful competitor will be honored accordingly.
The chivalric spirit which prompted Faraday
to devote his life to the study of nature may actuate
a few noble men to give their life to scientific work;
but, if we wish to cultivate this highest class of men
in science, we must open a career for them worthy of
their efforts.

Jenny Lind, with her beautiful voice, would have
cultivated it to some extent in her native village;
yet who would expect her to travel over the world,
and give concerts for nothing? and how would she
have been able to do so if she had wished? And so
the scientific man, whatever his natural talents, must
have instruments and a library, and a suitable and
respectable salary to live upon, before he is able to
exert himself to his full capacity. This is true of
advance in all the higher departments of human
learning, and yet something more is necessary. It is
not those in this country who receive the largest
salary, and have positions in the richest colleges, who
have advanced their subject the most: men receiving
the highest salaries, and occupying the professor's
chair, are to-day doing absolutely nothing in pure
science, but are striving by the commercial applications
of their science to increase their already large
salary. Such pursuits, as I have said before, are
honorable in their proper place; but the duty of a
professor is to advance his science, and to set an example
of pure and true devotion to it which shall
demonstrate to his students and the world that there
is something high and noble worth living for. Moneychangers
are often respectable men, and yet they
were once severely rebuked for carrying on their trade
in the court of the temple.

Wealth does not constitute a university, buildings
do not: it is the men who constitute its faculty,
and the students who learn from them. It is the
last and highest step which the mere student takes.
He goes forth into the world, and the height to which
he rises has been influenced by the ideals which
he has consciously or unconsciously imbibed in his
university.
If the professors under whom he has
studied have been high in their profession, and have
themselves had high ideals; if they have considered
the advance of their particular subject their highest
work in life, and are themselves honored for their intellect
throughout the world, - the student is drawn
toward that which is highest, and ever after in
life has high ideals. But if the student is taught
by what are sometimes called good teachers, and
teachers only, who know little more than the student,
and who are often surpassed and even despised by
him, no one can doubt the lowered tone of his mind.
He finds that by his feeble efforts he can surpass
one to whom a university has given its highest honor;
and he begins to think that he himself is a born
genius, and the incentive to work is gone. He is
great by the side of the molehill, and does not know
any mountain to compare himself with.

A university should not only have great men in its
faculty, but have numerous minor professors and
assistants of all kinds, and should encourage the
highest work, if for no other reason than to encourage
the student to his highest efforts.

But, assuming that the professor has high ideals,
wealth such as only a large and high university can
command is necessary to allow him the fullest development.

And this is specially so in our science of physics.
In the early days of physics and chemistry, many of
the fundamental experiments could be performed
with the simplest apparatus. And so we often find
the names of Wollaston and Faraday mentioned as
needing scarcely any thing for their researches.
Much can even now be done with the simplest apparatus;
and nobody, except the utterly incompetent,
need stop for want of it. But the fact remains, that
one can only be free to investigate in all departments
of chemistry and physics, when he not only has a
complete laboratory at his command, but a friend to
draw on for the expenses of each experiment. That
simplest of the departments of physics, namely,
astronomy, has now reached such perfection that nobody
can expect to do much more in it without a
perfectly equipped observatory; and even this would
be useless without an income sufficient to employ a
corps of assistants to make the observations and computations.
But even in this simplest of physical
subjects, there is great misunderstanding. Our country
has very many excellent observatories: and yet
little work is done in comparison, because no provision
has been made for maintaining the work of the
observatory; and the wealth which, if concentrated,
might have made one effective observatory which
would prove a benefit to astronomical science, when
scattered among a half-dozen, merely furnishes telescopes
for the people in the surrounding region to
view the moon with. And here I strike the keynote
of at least one need of our country, if she would
stand well in science; and the following item which
I clip from a newspaper will illustrate the matter: -

"The eccentric old Canadian, Arunah Huntington,
who left $200,000 to be divided among the public
schools of Vermont, has done something which will
be of little practical value to the schools. Each district
will be entitled to the insignificant sum of $10,
which will not advance much the cause of education."

Nobody will dispute the folly of such a bequest, or
the folly of filling the country with telescopes to look
at the moon, and calling them observatories. How
much better to concentrate the wealth into a few
parcels, and make first-class observatories and institutions
with it!

Is it possible that any of our four hundred colleges
and universities have love enough of learning to
unite with each other and form larger institutions?
Is it possible that any have such a love of truth that
they are willing to be called by their right name?
I fear not; for the spirit of expectation, which is
analogous to the spirit of gambling, is strong in the
American breast, and each institution which now,
except in name, slumbers in obscurity, expects in
time to bloom out into full prosperity. Although
many of them are under religious influence, where
truth is inculcated, and where men are taught to take
a low seat at the table in order that they may be honored
by being called up higher, and not dishonored
by being thrust down lower, yet these institutions
have thrust themselves into the highest seats, and
cannot probably be dislodged.

But would it not be possible to so change public
opinion that no college could be founded with a less
endowment than say $1,000,000, or no university
with. less than three or four times that amount?
From the report of the commissioner of education,
I learn that such a change is taking place; that the
tendency towards large institutions is increasing,
and that it is principally in the west and south-west
that the multiplication of small institutions with big
names is to be feared most, and that the east is almost
ready for the great coming university.

The total wealth of the four hundred colleges and
universities in 1880 was about $40,000,000 in buildings,
and $43,000,000 in productive funds.This
would be sufficient for one great university of $10,000,000,
four of $5,000,000, and twenty-six colleges
of $2,000,000 each. But such an idea can of course
never be carried out. Government appropriations
are out of the question, because no political trickery
must be allowed around the ideal institution.

In the year 1880 the private bequests to all schools
and colleges amounted to about $5,500,000; and,
although there was one bequest of $1,250,000, yet the
amount does not appear to be phenomenal. It would
thus seem that the total amount was about five million
dollars in one year, of which more than half is
given to so-called colleges and universities. It would
be very difficult to regulate these bequests so that
they might be concentrated sufficiently to produce an
immediate result. But the figures show that generosity
is a prominent feature of the American people,
and that the needs of the country only have to be
appreciated to have the funds forthcoming. We
must make the need of research and of pure science
felt in the country. We must live such lives of pure
devotion to our science, that all shall see that we ask
for money, not that we may live in indolent ease
at the expense of charity, but that we may work
for that which has advanced\*and will advance the
world more than any other subject, both intellectually
and physically. We must live such lives as to
neutralize the influence of those who. in high places
have degraded their profession, or have given themselves
over to ease, and do nothing for the science
which they represent. Let us do what we can with
the present means at our disposal. There is not one
of us who is situated in the position best adapted to
bring out all his powers, and to allow him to do most
for his science. All have their difficulties, and I do
not think that circumstances will ever radically
change a man. If a man has the instinct of research
in him, it will always show itself in some form. But
circumstances may direct it into new paths, or may
foster it so that what would otherwise have died as a
bud now blossoms and ripens into the perfect fruit.

Americans have shown no lack of invention in
small things; and the same spirit, when united to
knowledge and love of science, becomes the spirit of
research. The telegraph-operator, with his limited
knowledge of electricity and its laws, naturally turns
his attention to the improvement of the only electrical
instrument he knows any thing about; and his
researches would be confined to the limited sphere of
his knowledge, and to the simple laws with which he
is acquainted. But as his knowledge increases, and
the field broadens before him, as he studies the mathematical
theory of the subject, and the electro-magnetic
theory of light loses the dim haze due to distance,
and becomes his constant companion, the
telegraph-instrument becomes to him a toy, and his
effort to discover something new becomes research
in pure science.

It is useless to attempt to advance science until
one has mastered the science: he must step to the
front before his blows can tell in the strife. Furthermore,
I do not believe anybody can be thorough in
any department of science, without wishing to advance
it. In the study of what is known, in the
reading of the scientific journals, and the discussions
therein contained of the current scientific questions,
one would obtain an impulse to work, even though it
did not before exist. And the same spirit which
prompted him to seek what was already known,
would make him wish to know the unknown. And
I may say that I never met a case of thorough knowledge
in my own science, except in the case of wellknown
investigators. I have met men who talked
well, and I have sometimes asked myself why they
did not do something; but further knowledge of
their character has shown me the superficiality of
their knowledge. I am no longer a believer in men
who could do something if they would, or would do
something if they had a chance. They are impostors.
If the true spirit is there, it will show itself in spite
of circumstances.

As I remarked before, the investigator in pure
science is usually a professor. He must teach as
well as investigate. It is a question which has been
discussed in late years, as to whether these two functions
would better be combined in the same individual,
or separated. It seems to be the opinion of most, that
a certain amount of teaching is conducive, rather
than otherwise, to the spirit of research. I myself
think that this is true, and I should myself not like
to give up my daily lecture. But one must not be
overburdened. I suppose that the true solution, in
many cases, would be found in the multiplication of
assistants, not only for the work of teaching but of
research. Some men are gifted with more ideas than
they can work out with their own hands, and the
world is losing much by not supplying them with
extra hands. Life is short: old age comes quickly,
and the amount one pair of hands can do is very
limited. What sort of shop would that be, or what
sort of factory, where one man had to do all the work
with his own hands? It is a fact in nature, which no
democracy can change, that men are not equal, -- that
some have brains, and some hands. And no idle
talk about equality can ever subvert the order of the
universe.

I know of no institution in this country where assistants
are supplied to aid directly in research. Yet
why should it not be so? And even the absence of
assistant professors and assistants of all kinds, to aid
in teaching, is very noticeable, and must be remedied
before we can expect much.

There are many physical problems, especially those
requiring exact measurements, which cannot be
carried out by one man, and can only be successfully
attacked by the most elaborate apparatus, and
with a full corps of assistants. Such are Regnault's
experiments on the fundamental laws of gases and
vapors, made thirty or forty years ago by aid from the
French government, and which are the standards to
this day. Although these experiments were made
with a view to the practical calculation of the steam-engine,
yet they were carried out in such a broad
spirit that they have been of the greatest theoretical
use. Again, what would astronomy have done without
the endowments of observatories? By their
means, that science has become the most perfect of
all branches of physics, as it should be from its simplicity.
There is no doubt, in my mind, that similar
institutions for other branches of physics, or, better,
to include the whole of physics, would be equally successful.
A large and perfectly equipped physical
laboratory with its large revenues, its corps of professors
and assistants, and its machine-shop for the
construction of new apparatus, would be able to advance
our science quite as much as endowed observatories
have astronomy. But such a laboratory
should not be founded rashly. The value will depend
entirely on the physicist at its head, who has to
devise the plan, and to start it into practical work-
ing. Such a man will always be rare, and cannot
always be obtained. After one had been successfully
started, others could follow; for imitation requires
little brains.

One could not be certain of getting the proper man
every time, but the means of appointment should be
most carefully studied so as to secure a good average.
There can be no doubt that the appointment should
rest with a scientific body capable of judging the highest
work of each candidate.

Should any popular element enter, the person
chosen would be either of the literary-scientific order,
or the dabbler on the outskirts who presents his small
discoveries. in the most theatrical manner. What is
required is a man of depth, who has such an insight
into physical science that he can tell when blows will
best tell for its advancement.

Such a grand laboratory as I describe does not exist
in the world, at present, for the study of physics. But
no trouble has ever been found in obtaining means to
endow astronomical science. Everybody can appreciate,
to some extent, the value of an observatory; as
astronomy is the simplest of scientific subjects, and
has very quickly reached a position where elaborate
instruments and costly computations are necessary to
further advance. The whole domain of physics is so
wide that workers have hitherto found enough to do.
But it cannot always be so, and the time has even
now arrived when such a grand laboratory should be
founded. Shall our country take the lead in this matter,
or shall we wait for foreign countries to go be-
fore? They will be built in the future, but when and
how is the question.

Several institutions are now putting up laboratories
for physics. They are mostly for teaching, and we
can expect only a comparatively small amount of
work from most of them. But they show progress;
and, if the progress be as quick in this direction as in
others, we should be able to see a great change before
the end of our lives.

As stated before, men are influenced by the sympathy
of those with whom they come in contact. It
is impossible to immediately change public opinion
in our favor; and, indeed, we must always seek to
lead it, and not be guided by it. For pure science is
the pioneer who must not hover about cities and
civilized countries, but must strike into unknown
forests, and climb the hitherto inaccessible mountains
which lead to and command a view of the promised
land, -the land which science promises us in the
future; which shall not only flow with milk and honey,
but shall give us a better and more glorious idea. of
this wonderful universe. We must create a public
opinion in our favor, but it need not at first be the
general public. We must be contented to stand aside,
and see the honors of the world for a time given to
our inferiors; and must be better contented with the
approval of our own consciences, and of the very few
who are capable of judging our work, than of the
whole world beside. Let us look to the other physicists,
not in our own town, not in our own country,
but in the whole world, for the words of praise which
are to encourage us, or the words of blame which are
to stimulate us to renewed effort. For what to us is
the praise of the ignorant? Let us join together in
the bonds of our scientific societies, and encourage
each other, as we are now doing, in the pursuit of
our favorite study; knowing that the world will some
time recognize our services, and knowing, also, that
we constitute the most important element in human
progress.

But danger is also near, even in our societies.
When the average tone of the society is low, when the
highest honors are given to the mediocre, when third-class
men are held up as examples, and when trifling
inventions are magnified into scientific discoveries,
then the influence of such societies is prejudicial. A
young scientist attending the meetings of such a society
soon gets perverted ideas. To his mind, a molehill
is a mountain, and the mountain a molehill. The
small inventor or the local celebrity rises to a greater
height, in his mind, than the great leader of science
in some foreign land. He gauges himself by the
molehill, and is satisfied with his stature; not knowing
that he is but an atom in comparison with the mountain,
until, perhaps, in old age, when it is too late.
But, if the size of the mountain had been seen at
first, the young scientist would at least have been
stimulated in his endeavor to grow.

We cannot all be men of genius; but we can, at
least, point them out to those around us. We may
not be able to benefit science much ourselves; but
we can have high ideals on the subject, and instil
them into those with whom we come in contact. For
the good of ourselves, for the good of our country,
for the good to the world, it is incumbent on us to
form a true estimate of the worth and standing of
persons aud things, and to set before our own minds
all that is great and good and noble, all that is most
important for scientific advance, above the mean and
low and unimportant.

It is very often said, that a man has a right to his
opinion. This might be true for a man on a desert
island, whose error would influence only himself.
But when he opens his lips to instruct others, or even
when he signifies his opinions by his daily life, then
he is directly responsible for all his errors of judgment
or fact. He has no right to think a molehill as
big as a mountain, nor to teach it, any more than he
has to think the world flat, and teach that it is so.
'The facts and laws of our science have not equal
importance, neither have the men who cultivate the
science achieved equal results. One thing is greater
than another, and we have no right to neglect the
order. Thus shall our minds be guided aright, and
our efforts be toward that which is the highest.

Then shall we see that no physicist of the first
class has ever existed in this country, that we must
look to other countries for our leaders in that subject,
and that the few excellent workers in our country
must receive many accessions from without before
they can constitute an American science, or do their
share in the world's work.

But let me return to the subject of scientific societies.
Here American science has its hardest problem
to contend with. There are very many local societies
dignified by high-sounding names, each having its
local celebrity, to whom the privilege of describing
some crab with an extra claw, which he found in his
morning ramble, is inestimable. And there are some
academies of science, situated at our seats of learning,
which are doing good work in their locality. But
distances are so great that it is difficult to collect men
together at any one point. The American association,
which we are now attending, is not a scientific
academy, and does not profess to be more than a gathering
of all who are interested in science, to read
papers and enjoy social intercourse. The National
academy of sciences contains eminent men from the
whole country, but then it is only for the purpose of
advising the government freely on scientific matters.
It has no building, it has no library; and it publishes
nothing except the information which it freely gives
to the government, which does nothing for it in return.
It has not had much effect directly on American
science; but the liberality of the government in
the way of scientific expeditions, publications, etc.,
is at least partly due to its influence, and in this
way it has done much good. But it in no way takes
the place of the great Royal society, or the great academies
of science at Paris, Berlin, Vienna, St. Petersburgh,
Munich, and, indeed, all the European capitals
and large cities. These, by their publications, give
to the young student, as well as the more advanced
physicist, models of all that is considered excellent;
and to become a member is one of the highest honors
to which he can aspire, while to write a memoir which
the academy considers worthy to be published in its
transactions excites each one to his highest effort.

The American academy of sciences in Boston is
perhaps our nearest representation of this class of
academies, but its limitation of membership to the
State deprives it of its national character.
But there is another matter which influences the
growth of our science.

As it is necessary for us still to look abroad for our
highest inspiration in pure science, and as science is
not an affair of one town or one country, but of the
whole world, it becomes us all to read the current
journals of science and the great transactions of foreign
societies, as well as those of our own countries.
These great transactions and journals should be in
the library of every institution of learning in the
country, where science is taught. How can teachers
and professors be expected to know what has been
discovered in the past, or is being discovered now, if
these are not provided? Has any institution a right
to mentally starve the teachers whom it employs, or
the students who come to it? There can be but
one answer to this; and an institution calling itself a
university, and not having the current scientific journals
upon its table or the transactions of societies
upon its library-shelves, is certainly not doing its best
to cultivate all that is best in this world.

We call this a free country, and yet it is the only
one where there is a direct tax upon the pursuit of
science. The low state of pure science in our country
may possibly be attributed to the youth of the
country; but a direct tax, to prevent the growth of
our country in that subject, cannot be looked upon as
other than a deep disgrace. I refer to the duty upon
foreign books and periodicals. In our science, no
books above elementary ones have ever been published,
or are likely to be published, in this country;
and yet every teacher in physics must have then, not
only in the college library, but on his own shelves,
and must pay the government of this country to
allow him to use a portion of his small salary to buy
that which is to do good to the whole country. All
freedom of intercourse which is necessary to foster
our growing science is thus broken off; and that which
might, in time, relieve our country of its mediocrity,
is nipped in the bud by our government, which is most
liberal when appealed to directly on scientific subjects.

One would think that books in foreign languages
might be admitted free; but to please the half-dozen
or so workmen who reprint German books, not
scientific, our free intercourse with that country is
cut off. Our scientific associations and societies must
make themselves heard in this matter, and show those
in authority how the matter stands.

In conclusion, let me say once more, that I do not
believe that our country is to remain long in its
present position. The science of physics, in whose
applications our country glories, is to arise among us,
and make us respected by the nations of the world.
Such a prophecy may seen rash with regard to a nation
which does not yet do enough physical work to support.
a physical journal. But we know the speed with
which we advance in this country: we see cities
Springing up in a night, and other wonders performed
at an unprecedented rate. And now we see physical
laboratories being built, we see a great demand for
thoroughly trained physicists, who have not shirked
their mathematics, both as professors and in so-called
practical life; and perhaps we have the feeling, common
to all true Americans, that our country is going
forward to a glorious future, when we shall lead the
world in the strife for intellectual prizes as we now
do in the strife for wealth.

But if this is to be so, we must not aim low.. The
problems of the universe cannot be solved without
labor: they cannot be attacked without the proper
intellectual as well as physical tools; and no physicist
need expect to go far without his mathematics. No
one expects a horse to win in a great and long race
who has not been properly trained; and it would be
folly to attempt to win with one, however pure his
blood and high his pedigree, without it. The problems
we solve are more difficult than any race: the
highest intellect cannot hope to succeed without proper
preparation. The great prizes are reserved for the
greatest efforts of the greatest intellects, who have
kept their mental eye bright and flesh hard by constant
exercise. Apparatus can be bought with money,
talents may come to us at birth; but our mental tools,
our mathematics, our experimental ability, our know|-
edge of what others have done before us, all have to
be obtained by work. The time is almost past, even
in our own country, when third-rate men can find a
place as teachers, because they are unfit for every thing
else. We wish to see brains and learning, combined
with energy and immense working-power, in the professor's
chair; but, above all, we wish to see that high
and chivalrous spirit which causes one to pursue his
idea in spite of all difficulties, to work at the problems
of nature with the approval of his own conscience,
and mot of men before him. Let him fit himself for
the struggle with all the weapons which mathematics
and the experience of those gone before him
can furnish, and let him enter the arena with the
fixed and stern purpose to conquer. Let him not
be contented to stand back with the crowd of mediocrity,
but let him press forward for a front place in
the strife.

The whole universe is before us to study. The
greatest labor of the greatest minds has only given
us a few pearls; and yet the limitless ocean, with its
hidden depths filled with diamonds and precious
stones, is before us. The problem of the universe is
yet unsolved, and the mystery involved in one single
atom yet eludes us. The field of research only
opens wider and wider as we advance, and our
minds are lost in wonder and astonishment at the
grandeur and beauty unfolded before us. Shall we
help in this grand work, or not? Shall our country
do its share, or shall it still live in the almshouse of
the world?

向这同一方向。

多少代以来，只有少数学习科学的学生将对自然的研究珍视为最崇高的追求，无论富裕或者贫穷，他们
都有一个共同点:对自然及其规律充满热爱。世界因科学的应用而带来的进步应归功于这少数人，但他们
中只有极少数曾从世人那里得到他们应有的回报。法拉弟(Faraday Michael，1791-1867，英国物理

贫困，这也是今后一段时期中跟随他脚步的人必将面对的命运。但是，未来还是有因纯粹热爱而研究自

道里面究竟有什么。我们通过重力定律解释了行星的运动，但是谁将解释是什么样的力量让两个相隔数
百万英里的天体彼此相向运动呢?今天，我们能够非常容易地测量电量和电流，但是我们有方法来解释电

应该说，所有参与工作的人都有机会，竞赛已经开始，但问题的解决不是一蹴而就的事，它需要在不确

当其它国家在竞赛中领先时，我们国家能满足于袖手旁观吗?难道我们总是匍匐在尘土中去捡富人餐桌上
掉下来的面包屑，并因为我们有更多的面包屑而认为自己比他更富裕吗?但我们忘记了这样的事实:他拥有
面包，这是所有面包屑的来源。难道我们卑贱如猪，认为谷粒和谷壳的价值比珍珠高得多吗?如果我对时

但这是可以恢复的。在一个新国家中，生存的需求是首先需要关注的事情。

但是，让整个世界更轻松地生活是应用科学的使命。我读到过这样一个故事，它阐明了应用科学在世界

我认为人类真正的追求是智慧。对自然所有分支的科学研究，对数学的研究，对人类过去和现在的研究，
对艺术的追求，以及对所有这些事业的培育是这个世界上最伟大、最高贵的事业，它们是人类最高级的
职业。对有更高理想的人来说，商业、科学的应用和财富的积累是一种诅咒，但对世界上那些没有能力

得可怜，因为仪器设备和资料文献的匮缺，因为他们所处的精神环境，而更重要的是因为生活理想不高，
他们被迫将自己的业余时间花在给应用科学或其它增加财富的手段上。那么，我们该怎样兑现对那些少
数人中的少数人的尊敬呢?尽管也面临所有这些现实困难，他们仍然坚定不移地认定目标，持之以恒地从
事纯科学研究，为这个世界做出最珍贵的贡献。他们创造的伟大知识丰富了我们对宇宙的认识，当这些
知识被应用到物质生活时，成千上万人的生活更加富裕，我们中的每个人都受益于此。也有这样一些人，
他们拥有从事纯科学研究所需的所有设施，他们拥有丰厚的薪水以及每一件工作仪器，但却全力投入了
商业性的工作，他们到法院作证，去做其它可增加现有丰厚收入的工作。如果这些人放弃教授的头衔，
而冠之以化学顾问专家或物理学顾问专家的称谓，那么他们是值得受到尊重的，我们的社会确实需要这
样的人。但是，如果一个人拥有最著名大学的教授席位，而他的精力和能力却用在科学知识的商业化应
用上，他以尊贵的身份出现在社区，在报纸又成为科学的解释者，那么这对他和他所在的学院来说都是
一种耻辱。这是对其所在科学事业的致命打击。给他以恰如其分的称谓，他马上就会成为这个社会中有
用的一员。将一个按规则并能以身作则培育科学的人放在他的职位上，结果会多么的不同!那些正在世上
寻找生活目标的年轻人，看到他们眼前这个高尚和高贵的人生，他们就会发现世界上还比积累财富更为
尊贵的东西，于是他们就愿意将生命奉献给相同的事业，他们就会尊重那些将他们引向更高境界的教授，
这一境界是他们通过其它途径所不能企及的。

我并不想在这个问题上被误解。因发明而获得财富或者在某些情况下从事商业化的科学工作并不是一件
有失体面的事。但是，纯科学应该是具有教授职位的人的追求目标，这个目标之伟大是毫无疑问的。如
果我们生活的目标是追求财富，那就让我们诚实地从事商业，与他人竞争财富，但是如果我们选择了我
们认为更崇高的事业，那么就说到做到，无论贫富都随遇而安，二者都不能改变既定的追求。

**教育的目的是促进科学进步**

教学工作会消耗大部分精力，这也是绝大多数在教授职位上不进行任何科学工作的人的一个借口，但是
常言道“有志者事竟成”。很少本国教授所承担的教学或演讲工作像德国教授那么繁重，后者却以在科
学期刊上发表详细阐述、精心写作的论文而著名。我自己也肩负教育工作，深知这意味着什么，然而，
在这里我仍然坚持认为，只要您愿意，您就会找出时间来做科学研究。但是，在这里我们依然无法逃避
这个国家的诅咒:平庸。我们的学院和大学很少寻找有声誉的一流水平人士，我甚至听说过这样的事，一
所知名学院的董事曾经声称教授不需要做研究，因为这是浪费时间。我高兴地看到在该学院的优秀科学
家的呼吁下，该董事会的大多数董事都不认可这位董事的观点。

毫无疑问，教学工作是重要的。一位成功的教师应该受到尊重，但是，如果他没有引导学生向最高方向
努力，难道他不该受到谴责吗?我们国家的绝大多数纯科学都是在大学和学院中进行的，但据统计表明，
美国有380或者400左右的机构称自己为学院或大学，而只有16所学院和大学的投入金额达到或超过了50万，
其中只有一半的基金达到或超过了100万。在世界上将一所经费不足100万美元的机构称为大学实在荒唐，
然而我们有100多所这样的机构就是以这样的方式滥用了“大学”之名，实际上它们中的大多数是值得尊
敬的学院。当然，这类事情只会存在于一个民主的国家，它所自豪的是将所有的东西都降低到了同一层
次。或者说，这类事情只可能存在于这样一个民主国家的早期，因为明智的公众很快就会发现:一个错误
的称谓并不能改变事物本身的性质，这一真理才是我们应该告诉这个国家的青年人最为重要的事情。人
们也许会争辩说，所有这些机构在教育方面都做出了好的工作，许多负担不起学院和大学费用的年轻人
在这里接受教育。我并不反对教育，我所反对的是降低我们国家年轻人的理想。要让他们知道他们正在
上的是一所学校而不是一所大学；要让他们知道学校之上是学院，学院之上是大学；要让他们知道他们
只接受了一半的教育，他们与世界上的一些人相比如原子般微不足道。换句话说，他们应该被告知真相。

教师是一个受尊重的职位，但这个职位不会因一个假定的错误头衔而变得更为崇高。而且，头衔越多，
越容易获得，它就越没有值得追求的价值。当教授职位的工作和能力有明确要求时，当教授被要求要跟
上所在领域的发展并要尽全力促进领域的发展时，特别是当他因这些原因而被选出时，那么教授就是一
个值得为之努力争取的职位，成功的竞争者就会得到相应的尊重。骑士精神促使法拉弟将生命奉献给对
自然的研究，这一精神也将激励少数高贵的人们将他们的生命奉献给科学事业，但是如果我们希望在科
学界培育这种最高级的人才，那么我们必须向他们展示一个他们值得为之出付出的事业。

在这个国家中，并不是那些拿最高薪水并在最富裕的大学拥有职位的人最大程度地促进了其所在学科的
进步，那些拿最高薪水并拥有教授职位的人今天所做的事绝对不是纯科学研究，而是科学知识的商业应
用，目的是增加他们已经很高的收入。如前所述，在恰当的职位上做这种追求是值得尊重的，但是教授
的职责是促进科学的进步，他应该向学生和世界展示一个完全、真实的献身科学的榜样，告诉他们生命
中还有更崇高的价值。货币兑换者常常是受人尊重的人，但是耶酥曾经严厉地谴责他们在教堂的大厅中
进行交易。

财富不能成就大学，大楼也不能，大学是由教授和跟随他们学习的学生们构成的。大学是少数学生能够
踏入的最后和最高一步，之后，他走向世界，他在大学里有意或无意感受到的理想会影响他今后所能达
到的高度。如果他跟随的教授在其职业中一直处于很高的地位，自己又有崇高的理想；如果这些教授认
为促进所在领域的进步是他们生命中最重要的工作，并因其智慧而受到全世界的尊重，那么这位学生就
会被引向最高处，甚至在他今后的一生中他都有更高的理想。但是，如果这位学生被一些当时所谓的好
老师所教育，这些老师所知道的只比学生多一点，并常常被学生超过甚至轻视，那么没有人会怀疑这位
学生的品味低下。这位学生发现只要他稍加努力，他就能超过他所在的大学中拥有最高荣誉的人，于是
他开始认为自己是一个天才，工作的动力随之消失了，旁边的小土丘让他感到自己是一个伟大的人，但
他不知道世界上还有他无法比拟的大山。

一所大学的老师队伍中不仅要有伟大的人，而且还要有无数的各类小教授和助理，并要鼓励他们从事最
高级的工作，不为别的原因，而是为了鼓励学生们要尽他们最大的努力。但是，假如这位教授有高尚的
理想，拥有大而且高级的大学所给他掌握的财富，那么，他就有充分发展其才能的机会。

**社会应集中力量为科学研究提供必要的条件**

当然，现在仍然可以用最简单的设备做很多事情，除了完全不胜任者，没有任何人会因为缺少设备而停
止工作。但是现实却是这样的，只有当一个人不仅拥有完整的实验室，而且还有一位可以为他支付每一
个实验费用的朋友时，他才可能自由地在所有的化学和物理学科中做研究。物理系中最简单的部门如天
文学已经达到了这样一种状态:如果没有装备完善的天文台，研究人员基本上什么都不能做，而且如果没
有经费聘请一批实施观测和计算的助手，这一切也是没有用的。我们国家拥有许多非常好的天文台，然
而相比而言所做的工作却太少了，如果将财富集中，也许可以有一个更有效率的天文台，而且将会证明
这对天文科学发展更有利。相反，这些经费分散在六、七个地方，仅能够为附近地区的人们提观测月亮
的望远镜。

我们必须要让这个国家感觉到对研究和纯科学的需求；我们必须要让那些完全献身科学的人们活着，所
有的人都看到我们争取钱，但并不是因为要依靠慈善施舍懒惰度日，而是为了这样的一个事业，较之于
其它任何学问，这个事业在知识上和物质上已经并将更多地促进世界的进步；我们必须这样生活，以消
除那些损害了职业尊严的高位者的影响，或者是那些让自己轻松过日子却没有为其所代表的学科做一点
事的人的影响。让我们在目前能力所及的范围内做一切可能的事情。今天，我们中没有一个人拥有完全
适合的位置足以让他充分发挥能力，允许他做最好的科学。所有的人都有困难，但我不相信环境会从根
本上改变一个人，如果一个人对研究有一种直觉，它总会以某种方式表现出来。但是，环境也许会将它
带上新的征途，或许会给它以哺育，否则它可能会在含苞待放时死去，而不是像现在繁花盛开并结出完
美的果实。

在这个国家里，我没有发现一个机构设有直接辅助研究的助理。那么为什么不这样做呢?甚至缺乏助理教
授和其它各类助理来帮助教学也是非常明显的问题，这类问题必须得以补救。还有许多物理学问题，特
别是那些一个人无法完成的需要精确测量的工作，要完成这些工作需要配备精良的设备和完整的助手队
伍。就像捐赠的天文台促进天文学发展一样，一个经费充足、配备有教授和助手队伍，以及能够建造新
设备的机械工厂的大型、装备完善的物理实验室，同样能够促进物理学的进步。但是，这种实验室不能
草率建成，它的价值完全取决于担任实验室负责人的物理学家，他要制定计划，并通过实际的工作来启
动研究。这样的人总是很稀少的，而且不一定总能找得到。当然，我们不可能每次都想当然地得到适合
的人，但必须对任命方法进行仔细研究，以保证能够具有很好的平均水平。毫无疑问，任命必须由能够
判断每位候选者最高水平工作的科学团体来决定，如果有任何普通的因素加入进来，那么选出的人或者
只是对科学有一定了解的人，或者就是在科学的边缘有所涉猎却会以最夸张的方式展示自己小小发现的
人。我们所需要的是有深度的人，他对物质科学具有深刻见解，能够分辨什么时候能够对科学进展以最
关键的一击。

到目前为止，世界上还没有我所描述的这种伟大的物理实验室，但天文科学在获得捐赠方面却从来都没
有什么困难，每个人都会或多或少地认可天文台的价值，因为天文学是最简单明了的科学学科，很快就
能拥有精致的仪器和昂贵的计算，这是促进天文学发展所必需的。物理学天地是如此之广阔，以至到今
天研究人员还能发现许多可以做的事情。但是情况并非总是如此，现在已经到了需要建造大型实验室的
时刻，在这个问题上我们国家是起领导作用呢，还是等着让其它国家走在前面?未来肯定会建立这样的实
验室，但问题是什么时候建以及如何建。

几个研究机构正在设立物理实验室，它们主要将用于教学，可以想象其中绝大多数实验室只可能产生出
很少的工作，但是它们显示了进步，如果这种进步的速度如其它方面一样快，那么我们就能够想象在我
们的有生之年能够看到巨大的变化。

**树立崇高理想，攀登科学高峰**

人们总是惯于受到所接触的人的认同的影响，不可能立即按有利于我们的发展的方向转化，因此我们必
须努力去引导公众而不是被他们所左右。因为从事纯科学研究者是先驱，他们不可能在城市和已经文明
化的社会中徘徊，他们必须一头扎入未知的森林，攀登迄今无法涉足的高山，在那里俯览希望之乡的美
景。这是科学许诺在未来给我们的乐土，这片土地不仅流淌着奶和蜜，而且赋予我们更好和更伟大的思
想来认识这个神奇的宇宙。

我们必须形成有利于科学发展的公众舆论，但并不一定要从一般大众开始；我们必须满足于站在一旁，
看见世界的荣誉在一段时间里给予水平在我们之下的人；我们必须从自我良心的认可中，以及从极少数
有能力评判我们工作的人们的赞许中得到更良好的满足，而不在乎整个世界在说什么。我们要将目光投
向整个世界的物理学家，而不是本城或本国的物理学家，看看他们是怎么赞美或指责我们。赞美让我们
受到鼓励，指责则刺激我们重新努力。

无知者的赞美对我们有什么用?让我们像正在所做的那样，在我们的科学协会中紧密联系起来，在追求我
们喜爱的研究中彼此相互鼓励。我们知道世界需要时间才能承认我们的服务，我们也知道我们组成了人
类进步最重要的力量。

但即使在我们的科学协会里，危险离我们还是很近的。当协会的平均素质不高，当最高的荣誉给予平庸
之辈，三流水准的人被树立成榜样，微不足道的发明被夸大为科学发现时，这种协会的影响就是有害的，
一位参加这种协会会议的年轻科学家很快就会得到被歪曲的思想。在这位年轻科学家的思想中，小土丘
就是高山，高山反而成为小土丘；在他的头脑中，小小的发明家或当地的某个地方名人会比国际上的科
学领袖还高不可及。他就会用小土丘的标准来衡量自己，对自己状态感到满意，但他不知道与真正的高
山相比，他不过如原子般的大小。或许当他老的时候会明白这一点，但为时已晚!如果在他起步之初就能
看到高山的雄伟，那么这位年轻的科学家至少会在其成长过程中一直受到激励而努力向上。

不是所有的人都是天才，但至少我们能够指引他们向我们身边的天才学习。我们自己也许无法从科学获
得太多的好处，但我们可以有崇高的理想，并将它们逐渐渗透给我们接触到的人们。为了我们自己的幸
福，为了我们国家的富强，为了全世界的利益，我们应该形成一套能够真正衡量人或事的价值和地位的
评价体系，在我们的头脑中把所有高尚、有益和高贵的思想放在前面，把所有对科学发展重要的东西放
在前面，高于那些平庸的、低级的和琐碎的东西，这是我们义不容辞的责任!

人们总是说，一个人有权有自己的观点，对于在荒岛中生活的人来说这种说法也许是对的，因为他的错
误只会影响到他一个人，但是当他的话是用于教导别人时，特别是他的观点影响到他的日常生活时，他
就必须对他在判断或事实方面的所有错误承担直接责任。他没有权利将一个小土丘当作是高山，也不能
这样去教学生，就正如他不能认为地球是平的，并用这一观点来教学生一样。我们所发现的科学事实和
规律的重要性是不一样的，每个研究人员的科学成果的重要性也是不一样的。一件事比另一件事更伟大，
我们没有权力忽视这个秩序。这样，我们的心灵才会被正确地引导，我们的努力才会朝着最高的方向。
因此我们应该看到，这个国家还没有第一流的物理学家，我们必须到其它国家去寻找这个领域的领导，
在他们创建出美国科学或者为世界科学做出贡献前，我国少数杰出的人物必须从无到有得到更多的财富
支持。

美国科学有最棘手的问题需要处理。有太多的地方学会被冠以大而不当的名称，每个学会都有自己的知
名人士，他们有特权将他在早晨散步时发现的某些多出一支脚的螃蟹描述为无价之宝。我们也有一些科
学学会，在求知方面在当地做出很好的工作。但是，路途如此遥远，很难将人们集中到一个地方。今天
我们参加开会的美国科学促进会并不是一个科学机构，也不过是聚集了对科学有兴趣的人，让他们阅读
论文并享受交流的乐趣。美国国家科学院是由整个国家中最杰出的人士组成的，但它的作用只是在科学
问题上为政府提供免费的建议。

还有一个因素影响着我们科学事业的发展，那就是我们必需在纯科学方面从国外寻求最高的灵感，因为
科学不是局限于一个城市或国家的事务，而是整个世界的事业。所以，我们所有的人在阅读自己国家的
期刊时，也必须同时阅读最新的外国科学期刊和最重要的外国协会的学报。我们国家每一个从事科学教
育的机构的图书馆，都必须存放有这些伟大学报和期刊。如果没有提供这些期刊和学报，又怎么能期望
我们的教师或教授知道过去发现过什么，或是了解到现在正在发现些什么呢?哪一所机构有这样的权利让
它所聘请的教师或到此学习的学生们在精神上挨饿?这只能有一个答案:如果一个自称为大学的机构在它的
桌子上没有最新的科学期刊，或者在它的图书馆的书架上没有存放学会的学报，那么可以肯定的是，它
没尽最大的努力来促进和培育这个世界上最好的人和事。

我们称自己的国家是一个自由的国家，然而它却是世界上唯一一个对科学事业直接收税的国家。目前我
国纯科学水平低下或许是因为我们国家很年轻，但是直接向科学收税从而阻止我国科学的成长，却不能
说不是最为丢脸的事，这里我指的是对外国书籍和期刊的征税。在科学方面，我们国家还没有出版过或
者即将出版任何中小学教材以上的书籍，但是，物理学的每一位教师都必须拥有这样的书，不仅是在图
书馆的书架上，而且是在他们自己的书架上。这个国家有责任让这些教师有能力用自己微薄的薪水的一
部分来购买有利于整个国家的书籍。做不到这一点，所有有益于培育我国科学成长的自由交流就会被全
部中断，那些有助于提升我国高于平庸水平的新生事物在萌芽阶段就会被政府窒息，而这一政府在直接
的科学题目上给人的印象好像还是较为宽松自由的。

人们可能以为外文书籍免税进入不过是为了让某些人或重印德国书籍的工人高兴，因此剥夺了我们与德
国进行自由的科学交流的权利。我们的科学协会和社会必须让人们知道自己在此事上的立场，并让当局
明白事情的来龙去脉。

最后，让我再次重申:我不相信我们的国家会长期处于目前的这种状况。物理学的应用让我们国家繁荣富
强，我国物理学正在蒸蒸日上的发展，它会让我们受到世界各国家的尊重。这个预言似乎过于轻率，因
为我们国家所做的物理学工作还不足以支撑一个物理学期刊，但是我们知道这个国家前进的速度。我们
看见了城市在一夜之间拔地而起，其它的宏伟事业也以史无前例的速度前进；我们看见了正在建造的物
理学实验室；我们看见了对接受过全面训练而又不惧怕数学的物理学家的大量需求，需要他们做教授或
加入到所谓的现实生活中。也许我们与所有真正的美国人有着同样的感觉，我们的国家正在走向繁荣昌
盛的未来，我们将努力成为世界科学的领导，就像我们今天努力成为世界财富的领导一样。

如果要实现这样的理想，我们的目标就不能太低。没有辛勤的工作，宇宙的问题就不会被解开；没有一
定数量的知识分子和恰当的物理工具，这些问题就不会被攻克；缺乏数学知识的物理学家不会走得太远。
没有人会期待一匹没有经过良好训练的马能赢得伟大的长距离赛马比赛，同样，无论拥有多么纯正、高
贵的血统，指望没有良好训练的人获得大奖也是大错而特错的，因为我们要解决的问题远比任何竞赛都
更加困难，如果没有恰当的准备，即使最高智力水平的人也不会获得成功。最伟大的奖励等待着伟大的
智力付出最大的努力，他必须通过持续不断的实践来保持敏锐的目光和新鲜的思想。仪器和设备可以用
钱买来，天赋可能与生俱来，但是我们心智的工具，我们的数学知识，我们的实验能力，我们对前人创
造的知识的掌握，所有这些都需要通过努力才能获得。即使是在我们国家，三流水平的人因为什么都不
会做而成为教师的时代也已经过去。我们希望在教授席位上看到这样的人:他们聪明、好学、精力旺盛而
又充满工作动力。但最重要的是，我们希望看到能够激励人们排除万难去追求最高理想的高贵和勇敢的
精神，他们是在自己良知的赞许而不是他人的认可之下去探求自然界的难题。让他们用所有的数学武器、
前人的经验来武装自己，让他们胸怀征服的坚定目标走进这个竞技场，让他们不要满足于站在平庸之辈
的人群后面，让他们在竞争中力争站到最前列。

整个宇宙就在我们面前，等待我们去研究。最伟大的头脑经过最伟大的努力才能给我们带来少量的珍宝，
但是无穷的海洋在我们面前，它隐秘的深谷中充满了钻石和宝石。宇宙的问题还没有解决，即使一个原
子的秘密也还让我们迷惑不已。当我们不断前进时，研究的领域就会越来越宽广，自然的庄严和美丽让
我们惊讶和赞叹。我们能为这些伟大的工作做些什么吗?我们的国家是会承担起自己应有的责任呢?还是只
会生活在世界的施舍中呢?
