ADDRESS OF H. A. ROWLANd OF BALTIMORE, MD.,

VICE-PRESIDENT OF SECTION B, AUG. 15, 1883.

A PLEA FOR PURE SCIENCE.

> In using the word ' science,' I refer to physical science; as I > know 
nothing of natural science. Probably my remarks will, > however, apply to 
both, but I do not know.

The question is sometimes asked us as to the time of year we like the best. To 
my mind, the spring is the most delightful; for nature then recovers from the 
apathy of winter, and stirs herself to renewed life. The leaves grow, and the 
buds open, with a suggestion of vigor delightful to behold; and we revel in 
this ever-renewed life of nature. But this cannot always last. The leaves 
reach their limit; the buds open to the full, and pass away. Then we begin to 
ask ourselves whether all this display has been in vain, or whether it has led 
to a bountiful harvest.

So this magnificent country of ours has rivalled the vigor of spring in its 
growth. Forests have been levelled, aud cities built, and a large and powerful 
nation has been created on the face of the earth. We are proud of our advancement. 
We are proud of such cities as this, founded in a day upon a spot over which, 
but a few years since, the red man hunted the buffalo. But we must remember 
that this is only the spring of our country. Our glance must not be backward; 
for however beautiful leaves and blossoms are, and however marvellous their 
rapid increase, they are but leaves and blossoms after all. Rather should we 
look forward to discover what will be the outcome of all this, and what the 
chance of harvest. For if we do this in time, we may discover the worm which 
threatens the ripe fruit, or the barren spot where the harvest is withering 
for want of water.

I am required to address the so-called physical section of this association. 
Fain would I speak pleasant words to you on this subject; fain would I recount 
to you the progress made in this subject by my countrymen, and their noble 
efforts to understand the order of the universe. But I go out to gather the 
grain ripe to the harvest, and I find only tares. Here and there a noble head 
of grain rises above the weeds; but so few are they, that I find the majority 
of my countrymen know them not, but think that they have a waving harvest, 
while it is only one of weeds after all. American science is a thing of the 
future, and not of the present or past; and the proper course of one in my 
position is to consider what must be done to create a science of physics in 
this country, rather than to call telegraphs, electric lights, and such 
conveniences, by the name of science. I do not wish to underrate the value of 
all these things: the progress of the world depends on them, and he is to be 
honored who cultivates them successfully. So also the cook who invents a new 
and palatable dish for the table benefits the world to a certain degree; yet 
we do not dignify him by the name of a chemist. And yet it is not an uncommon 
thing, especially in American newspapers, to have the applications of science 
confounded with pure science; and some obscure American who steals the ideas 
of some great mind of the past, and enriches himself by the application of the 
same to domestic uses, is often lauded above the great originator of the idea, 
who might have worked out hundreds of such applications, had his mind possessed 
the necessary element of vulgarity. I have often been asked, which was the 
more important to the world, pure or applied science. To have the applications 
of a science, the science itself must exist. Should we stop its progress, and 
attend only to its applications, we should soon degenerate into a people like 
the Chinese, who have made no progress for generations, because they have been 
satisfied with the applications of science, and have never sought for reasons 
in what they have done. The reasons constitute pure science. They have known 
the application of gunpowder for centuries; and yet the reasons for its 
peculiar action, if sought in the proper manner, would have developed the 
science of chemistry, and even of physics, with all their numerous applications. 
By contenting themselves with the fact that gunpowder will explode, and 
seeking no farther, they have fallen behind in the progress of the world; and 
we now regard this oldest and most numerous of nations as only barbarians. And 
yet our own country is in this same state. But we have done better; for we 
have taken the science of the old world, and applied it to all our uses, 
accepting it like the rain of heaven, without asking whence it came, or even 
acknowledging the debt of gratitude we owe to the great and unselfish workers 
who have given it to us. And, like the rain of heaven, this pure science has 
fallen upon our country, and made it great and rich and strong.

To a civilized nation of the present day, the applications of science are a 
necessity; and our country has hitherto succeeded in this line, only for the 
reason that there are certain countries in the world where pure science has 
been and is cultivated, and where the study of nature is considered a noble 
pursuit. But such countries are rare, and those who wish to pursue pure 
science in our own country must be prepared to face public opinion in a manner 
which requires much moral courage. They must be prepared to be looked down 
upon by every successful inventor whose shallow mind imagines that the only 
pursuit of mankind is wealth, and that he who obtains most has best succeeded 
in this world. Everybody can comprehend a million of money; but how few can 
comprehend any advance in scientific theory, especially in its more abstruse 
portions! And this, I believe, is one of the causes of the small number of 
persons who have ever devoted themselves to work of the higher order in any 
human pursuit. Man is a gregarious animal, and depends very much, for his 
happiness, on the sympathy of those around him; and it is rare to find one 
with the courage to pursue his own ideals in spite of his surroundings. In 
times past, men were more isolated than at present, and each came in contact 
with a fewer number of people. Hence that time constitutes the period when the 
great sculptures, paintings, and poems were produced. Each man's mind was 
comparatively free to follow its own ideals, and the results were the great 
and unique works of the ancient masters. To-day the railroad and the telegraph, 
the books and newspapers, have united each individual man with the rest of the 
world: instead of his mind being an individual, a thing apart by itself, and 
unique, it has become so influenced by the outer world, and so dependent upon 
it, that it has lost its originality to a great extent. The man who in times 
past would naturally have been in the lowest depths of poverty, mentally and 
physically, to-day measures tape behind a counter, and with lordly air advises 
the naturally born genius how he may best bring his outward appearance down to 
a level with his own. A new idea he never had, but he can at least cover his 
mental nakedness with ideas imbibed from others. So the genius of the past 
soon perceives that his higher ideas are too high to be appreciated by the 
world: his mind is clipped down to the standard form; every natural offshoot 
upwards is repressed, until the man is no higher than his fellows. Hence the 
world, through the abundance of its intercourse, is reduced to a level. What 
was formerly a grand and magnificent landscape, with mountains ascending above 
the clouds, and depths whose gloom we cannot now appreciate, has become serene 
and peaceful. The depths have been filled, and the heights levelled, and the 
wavy harvests and smoky factories cover the landscape.

As far as the average man is concerned, the change is for the better. The 
average life of man is far pleasanter, and his mental condition better, than 
before. But we miss the vigor imparted by the mountains. We are tired of 
mediocrity, the curse of our country. We are tired of seeing our artists 
reduced to hirelings, and imploring congress to protect them against foreign 
competition. We are tired of seeing our countrymen take their science from 
abroad, and boast that they here convert it into wealth. We are tired of 
seeing our professors degrading their chairs by the pursuit of applied science 
instead of pure science; or sitting inactive while the whole world is open to 
investigation; lingering by the wayside while the problem of the universe 
remains unsolved. We wish for something higher and nobler in this country of 
mediocrity, for a mountain to relieve the landscape of its monotony. We are 
surrounded with mysteries, and have been created with minds to enjoy and 
reason to aid in the unfolding of such mysteries. Nature calls to us to study 
her, and our better feelings urge us in the same direction.

For generations there have been some few students of science who have esteemed 
the study of nature the most noble of pursuits. Some have been wealthy, and 
some poor; but they have all had one thing in common, - the love of nature and 
its laws. To these few men the world owes all the progress due to applied 
science, and yet very few ever received any payment in this world for their 
labors.

Faraday, the great discoverer of the principle on which all machines for 
electric lighting, electric railways, and the transmission of power, must 
rest, died a poor man, although others and the whole world have been enriched 
by his discoveries. And such must be the fate of the followers in his footsteps 
for some time to come.

But there will be those in the future who will study nature from pure love, 
and for them higher prizes than any yet obtained are waiting. We have but yet 
commenced our pursuit of science, and stand upon the threshold wondering what 
there is within. We explain the motion of the planet by the law of gravitation; 
but who will explain how two bodies, millions of miles apart, tend to go 
toward each other with a certain force?

We now weigh and measure electricity and electric currents with as much ease 
as ordinary matter, yet have we made an approach to an explanation of the 
phenomenon of electricity? Light is an undulatory motion, and yet do we know 
what it is that undulates? Heat is motion, yet do we know what it is that 
moves? Ordinary matter is a common substance, and yet who shall fathom the 
mystery of its internal constitution?

There is room for all in the work, and the race has but commenced. The 
problems are not to be solved in a moment, but need the best work of the best 
minds, for an indefinite time.

Shall our country be contented to stand by, while other countries lead in the 
race? Shall we always grovel in the dust, and pick up the crumbs which fall 
from the rich man's table, considering ourselves richer than he because we 
have more crumbs, while other countries lead in the race? Shall we always 
grovel in the dust, and pick up the crumbs which fall from the rich man's 
table, considering ourselves richer than he because we have more crumbs, while 
we forget that he has the cake, which is the source of all crumbs? Shall we be 
swine, to whom the corn and husks are of more value than the pearls? If I read 
aright the signs of the times, I think we shall not always be contented with 
our inferior position. From looking down we have almost become blind, but may 
recover. In a new country, the necessities of life must be attended to first. 
The curse of Adam is upon us all, and we must earn our bread.

But it is the mission of applied science to render this easier for the whole 
world. There is a story which I once read, which will illustrate the true 
position of applied science in the world. A boy, more fond of reading than of 
work, was employed, in the early days of the steam-engine, to turn the valve 
at every stroke. Necessity was the mother of invention in his case: his 
reading was disturbed by his work, and he soon discovered that he might become 
free from his work by so tying the valve to some movable portion of the 
engine, as to make it move its own valve. So I consider that the true pursuit 
of mankind is intellectual. The scientific study of nature in all its branches, 
of mathematics, of mankind in its past and present, the pursuit of art, and 
the cultivation of all that is great and noble in the world, -- these are the 
highest occupation of mankind. Commerce, the applications of science, the 
accumulation of wealth, are necessities which are a curse to those with high 
ideals, but a blessing to that portion of the world which has neither the 
ability nor the taste for higher pursuits.

As the applications of science multiply, living becomes easier, the wealth 
necessary for the purchase of apparatus can better be obtained, and the 
pursuit of other things beside the necessities of life becomes possible.

But the moral qualities must also be cultivated in proportion to the wealth of 
the country, before much can We done in pure science. The successful sculptor 
or painter naturally attains to wealth through the legitimate work of his 
profession. The novelist, the poet, the musician, all have wealth before them 
as the end of a successful career. But the scientist and the mathematician 
have no such incentive to work: they must earn their living by other pursuits, 
usually teaching, and only devote their surplus time to the true pursuit of 
their science. And frequently, by the small salary which they receive, by the 
lack of instrumental and literary facilities, by the mental atmosphere in 
which they exist, and, most of all, by their low ideals of life, they are led 
to devote their surplus time to applied science or to other means of increasing 
their fortune. How shall we, then, honor the few, the very few, who, in spite 
of all difficulties, have kept their eyes fixed on the goal, and have steadily 
worked for pure science, giving to the world a most precious donation, which 
has borne fruit in our greater knowledge of the universe and in the applications 
to our physical life which have enriched thou sands and benefited each one of 
us? There are also those who have every facility for the pursuit of science, 
who have an ample salary and every appliance for work, yet who devote themselves 
to commercial work, to testifying in courts of law, and to any other work to 
increase their present large income. Such men would be respectable if they 
gave up the name of professor, and took that of consulting chemists or 
physicists. And such men are needed in the community. But for a man to occupy 
the professor's chair in a prominent college, and, by his evergy and ability 
in the commercial applications of his science, stand before the local community 
in a prominent manner, and become the newspaper exponent of his science, is a 
disgrace both to him and his college. It is the deathblow to science in that 
region. Call him by his proper name, aid he becomes at once a useful member of 
the community. Put in his place a man who shall by precept and example 
cultivate his science, and how different is the result! Young men, looking 
forward into the world for something to do, see before them this high and 
noble life, and they see that there is something more honorable than the 
accumulation of wealth. They are thus led to devote their lives to similar 
pursuits, and they honor the professor who las drawn them to something higher 
than they might otherwise have aspired to reach.

I do not wish to be misunderstood in this matter. It is no disgrace to make 
money by an invention, or otherwise, or to do commercial scientific work under 
some circumstances. But let pure science be the aim of those in the chairs of 
professors, and so prominently the aim that there can be no mistake. If our 
aim in life is wealth, let us honestly engage in commercial pursuits, and 
compete with others for its possession. But if we choose a life which we 
consider higher, let us live up to it, taking wealth or poverty as it may 
chance to come to us, but letting neither turn us aside from our pursuit.

The work of teaching may absorb the energies of many; and, indeed, this is the 
excuse given by most for not doing any scientific work. But there is an old 
saying, that where there is a will there is a way. Few professors do as much 
teaching or lecturing as the German professors, who are also noted for their 
elaborate papers in the scientific journals. I myself have been burdened down 
with work, and know what it is; and yet I here assert that all can find time 
for scientific research if they desire it. But here, again, that curse of our 
country, mediocrity, is upon us. Our colleges and universities seldom call for 
first-class men of reputation, and I have even heard the trustee of a well-known 
college assert that no professor should engage in research because of the time 
wasted! I was glad to see, soon after, by the call of a prominent scientist to 
that college, that the majority of the trustees did not agree with him.

That teaching is important, goes without saying. A successful teacher is to be 
respected; but if he does not lead his scholars to that which is highest, is 
he not blameworthy? We are, then, to look to the colleges and universities of 
the land for most of the work in pure science which is done. Let us therefore 
examine these latter, and see what the prospect is.

One, whom perhaps we may here style a practical follower of Ruskin, has stated 
that while in this country he was variously designated by the title of 
captain, colonel, and professor. The story may or may not be true, but we all 
know enough of the customs of our countrymen not to dispute it on general 
principles. All men are born equal: some men are captains, colonels, and 
professors, and therefore all men are such. The logic is conclusive; and the 
same kind of logic seems to have been applied to our schools, colleges, and 
universities. I have before me the report of the commissioner of education for 
1880. According to that report, there were 389,[^1] or say, in round numbers, 
400 institutions, calling themselves colleges or universities, in our country! 
We may well exclaim that ours is a great country, having more than the whole 
world beside. The fact is sufficient. The whole earth would hardly support 
such a number of first-class institutions. The curse of mediocrity must be 
upon them, to swarm in such numbers. They must be a cloud of mosquitoes, 
instead of eagles as they profess. And this becomes evident on further 
analysis. About one-third aspire to the name of university; and I note one 
called by that name which has two professors and 18 students, and another 
having three teachers and 12 students! And these instances are not unique, for 
the number of small institutions and schools which call themselves universities 
is very great. It is difficult to decide from the statistics alone the exact 
standing of these institutions. The extremes are easy to manage. Who can doubt 
that an institution with over 800 students, and a faculty of 70, is of a 
higher grade than those above cited having 10 or 20 students and two or three 
in the faculty? Yet this is not always true; for I note one institution with 
over 500 students which is known to me personally as of the grade of a high 
school. The statistics are more or less defective, and it would much weaken 
the force of my remarks if I went too much into detail. I append the following 
tables, however, of 330 so-called colleges and universities: --

``` 218 had from   0  to 100 students.
 88   “    “ 100  “  200    “
 12   “    “ 200  “  300    “
  6   “    “ 300  “  500    “
  6 over     500 ```

Of 322 so-called colleges and universities: --

``` 206 had  0 to 10 in the faculty. 99  “   10 “  20     “     “ 17  “   20 
or over   “     “ ```

If the statistics were forthcoming, -- and possibly they may exist, -- we 
might also get an idea of the standing of these institutions and their 
approach to the true university idea, by the average age of the scholars. 
Possibly also the ratio of number of scholars to teachers might be of some 
help. All these methods give an approximation to the present standing of the 
institutions. But there is another method of attacking the problem, which is 
very exact, but it only gives us the possibilities of which the institution is 
capable. I refer to the wealth of the institution. In estimating the wealth, I 
have not included the value of grounds and buildings, for this is of little 
importance, either to the present or future standing of the institution. As 
good work can be done in a hovel as in a palace. I have taken the productive 
funds of the institution as the basis of estimate. I find: --

``` 234 have below    $500,000.
  8   “  between  $500,000 and $1,000,000.
  8   “  over     $1,000,000. ```

There is no fact more firmly established, all over the world, than that the 
higher education can never be made to pay for itself. Usually the cost. to a 
college, of educating a young man, very much exceeds what he pays for it, and 
is often three or four times as much. The higher the education, the greater 
this proportion will be; and a university of the highest class should anticipate 
only a small accession to its income from the fees of students. Hence the test 
I have applied must give a true representation of the possibilities in every 
case. According to the figures, only 16 colleges and universities have 
$500,000 or over of invested funds, and only one-half of these have $1,000,000 
and over. Now, even the latter sum is a very small endowment for a college; 
and to call any institution a university which has less than. $1,000,00, is to 
render it absurd in the face of the world. And yet more than 100 of our 
institutions, many of them very respectable colleges, have abused the word 
university? in this manner. It is to be hoped that the endowment of the more 
respectable of these institutions may be increased, as many of them deserve 
it; and their unfortunate appellation has probably been repented of long 
since.

But what shall we think of a community that gives the charter of a university 
to an institution with a total of $20,000 endowment, two so-called professors, 
and 18 students! or another with three professors, 12 students, and a total of 
$27,000 endowment, mostly invested in buildings! And yet there are very many 
similar institutions; there being 16 with three professors or less, and very 
many indeed with only four or five.

Such facts as these could only exist in a democratic country, where pride is 
taken in reducing every thing to a level. And I may also say, that it can only 
exist in the early days of such a democracy; for an intelligent public will 
soon perceive that calling a thing by a wrong name does not change its 
character, and that truth, above all things, should be taught to the youth of 
the nation.

It may be urged, that all these institutions are doing good work in education; 
and that many young men are thus taught, who could not afford to go to a true 
college or university. But I do not object to the education, -though I have no 
doubt an investigation would disclose equal absurdities here, - for it is 
aside from my object. But I do object to lowering the ideals of the youth of 
the country. Let them know that they are attending a school, and not a 
university; and let them know that above them comes the college, and above 
that the university. Let them be taught that they are only half-educated, and 
that there are persons in the world by whose site they are but atoms. In other 
words, let them be taught the truth.

It may be that some small institutions are of high gradle, especially those 
which are new; but who can doubt that more than two-thirds of our institutions 
calling themselves colleges and universities are unworthy of the name? Each 
one of these institutions has so-called professors, but it is evident that 
they can be only of the grade of teachers. Why should they not be so called? 
The position of teacher is an honored one, but is not made more honorable by 
the assumption of a false title. Furthermore, the multiplication of the title, 
and the ease with which it can be obtained, render it scarcely worth striving 
for. When the man of energy, ability, and perhaps genius is rewarded by the 
same title and emoluments as the commonplace man with the modicum of knowledge, 
who takes to teaching, not because of any aptitude for his work, but possibly 
because he has not the energy to compete with his fellow-men in business, then 
I say one of the inducements for first-class men to become professors is 
gone.

When work and ability are required for the position, and when the professor is 
expected to keep up with the progress of his subject, and to do all in his 
power to advance it, and when he is selected for these reasons, then the 
position will be worth working for, and the successful competitor will be 
honored accordingly. The chivalric spirit which prompted Faraday to devote his 
life to the study of nature may actuate a few noble men to give their life to 
scientific work; but, if we wish to cultivate this highest class of men in 
science, we must open a career for them worthy of their efforts.

Jenny Lind, with her beautiful voice, would have cultivated it to some extent 
in her native village; yet who would expect her to travel over the world, and 
give concerts for nothing? and how would she have been able to do so if she 
had wished? And so the scientific man, whatever his natural talents, must have 
instruments and a library, and a suitable and respectable salary to live upon, 
before he is able to exert himself to his full capacity. This is true of 
advance in all the higher departments of human learning, and yet something 
more is necessary. It is not those in this country who receive the largest 
salary, and have positions in the richest colleges, who have advanced their 
subject the most: men receiving the highest salaries, and occupying the 
professor's chair, are to-day doing absolutely nothing in pure science, but 
are striving by the commercial applications of their science to increase their 
already large salary. Such pursuits, as I have said before, are honorable in 
their proper place; but the duty of a professor is to advance his science, and 
to set an example of pure and true devotion to it which shall demonstrate to 
his students and the world that there is something high and noble worth living 
for. Moneychangers are often respectable men, and yet they were once severely 
rebuked for carrying on their trade in the court of the temple.

Wealth does not constitute a university, buildings do not: it is the men who 
constitute its faculty, and the students who learn from them. It is the last 
and highest step which the mere student takes. He goes forth into the world, 
and the height to which he rises has been influenced by the ideals which he 
has consciously or unconsciously imbibed in his university. If the professors 
under whom he has studied have been high in their profession, and have 
themselves had high ideals; if they have considered the advance of their 
particular subject their highest work in life, and are themselves honored for 
their intellect throughout the world, - the student is drawn toward that which 
is highest, and ever after in life has high ideals. But if the student is 
taught by what are sometimes called good teachers, and teachers only, who know 
little more than the student, and who are often surpassed and even despised by 
him, no one can doubt the lowered tone of his mind. He finds that by his 
feeble efforts he can surpass one to whom a university has given its highest 
honor; and he begins to think that he himself is a born genius, and the 
incentive to work is gone. He is great by the side of the molehill, and does 
not know any mountain to compare himself with.

A university should not only have great men in its faculty, but have numerous 
minor professors and assistants of all kinds, and should encourage the highest 
work, if for no other reason than to encourage the student to his highest 
efforts.

But, assuming that the professor has high ideals, wealth such as only a large 
and high university can command is necessary to allow him the fullest development.

And this is specially so in our science of physics. In the early days of 
physics and chemistry, many of the fundamental experiments could be performed 
with the simplest apparatus. And so we often find the names of Wollaston and 
Faraday mentioned as needing scarcely any thing for their researches. Much can 
even now be done with the simplest apparatus; and nobody, except the utterly 
incompetent, need stop for want of it. But the fact remains, that one can only 
be free to investigate in all departments of chemistry and physics, when he 
not only has a complete laboratory at his command, but a friend to draw on for 
the expenses of each experiment. That simplest of the departments of physics, 
namely, astronomy, has now reached such perfection that nobody can expect to 
do much more in it without a perfectly equipped observatory; and even this 
would be useless without an income sufficient to employ a corps of assistants 
to make the observations and computations. But even in this simplest of 
physical subjects, there is great misunderstanding. Our country has very many 
excellent observatories: and yet little work is done in comparison, because no 
provision has been made for maintaining the work of the observatory; and the 
wealth which, if concentrated, might have made one effective observatory which 
would prove a benefit to astronomical science, when scattered among a half-dozen, 
merely furnishes telescopes for the people in the surrounding region to view 
the moon with. And here I strike the keynote of at least one need of our 
country, if she would stand well in science; and the following item which I 
clip from a newspaper will illustrate the matter: -

“The eccentric old Canadian, Arunah Huntington, who left $200,000 to be 
divided among the public schools of Vermont, has done something which will be 
of little practical value to the schools. Each district will be entitled to 
the insignificant sum of $10, which will not advance much the cause of 
education.”

Nobody will dispute the folly of such a bequest, or the folly of filling the 
country with telescopes to look at the moon, and calling them observatories. 
How much better to concentrate the wealth into a few parcels, and make 
first-class observatories and institutions with it!

Is it possible that any of our four hundred colleges and universities have 
love enough of learning to unite with each other and form larger institutions? 
Is it possible that any have such a love of truth that they are willing to be 
called by their right name? I fear not; for the spirit of expectation, which 
is analogous to the spirit of gambling, is strong in the American breast, and 
each institution which now, except in name, slumbers in obscurity, expects in 
time to bloom out into full prosperity. Although many of them are under 
religious influence, where truth is inculcated, and where men are taught to 
take a low seat at the table in order that they may be honored by being called 
up higher, and not dishonored by being thrust down lower, yet these institutions 
have thrust themselves into the highest seats, and cannot probably be dislodged.

But would it not be possible to so change public opinion that no college could 
be founded with a less endowment than say $1,000,000, or no university with. 
less than three or four times that amount? From the report of the commissioner 
of education, I learn that such a change is taking place; that the tendency 
towards large institutions is increasing, and that it is principally in the 
west and south-west that the multiplication of small institutions with big 
names is to be feared most, and that the east is almost ready for the great 
coming university.

The total wealth of the four hundred colleges and universities in 1880 was 
about $40,000,000 in buildings, and $43,000,000 in productive funds.This would 
be sufficient for one great university of $10,000,000, four of $5,000,000, and 
twenty-six colleges of $2,000,000 each. But such an idea can of course never 
be carried out. Government appropriations are out of the question, because no 
political trickery must be allowed around the ideal institution.

In the year 1880 the private bequests to all schools and colleges amounted to 
about $5,500,000; and, although there was one bequest of $1,250,000, yet the 
amount does not appear to be phenomenal. It would thus seem that the total 
amount was about five million dollars in one year, of which more than half is 
given to so-called colleges and universities. It would be very difficult to 
regulate these bequests so that they might be concentrated sufficiently to 
produce an immediate result. But the figures show that generosity is a 
prominent feature of the American people, and that the needs of the country 
only have to be appreciated to have the funds forthcoming. We must make the 
need of research and of pure science felt in the country. We must live such 
lives of pure devotion to our science, that all shall see that we ask for 
money, not that we may live in indolent ease at the expense of charity, but 
that we may work for that which has advanced\*and will advance the world more 
than any other subject, both intellectually and physically. We must live such 
lives as to neutralize the influence of those who. in high places have 
degraded their profession, or have given themselves over to ease, and do 
nothing for the science which they represent. Let us do what we can with the 
present means at our disposal. There is not one of us who is situated in the 
position best adapted to bring out all his powers, and to allow him to do most 
for his science. All have their difficulties, and I do not think that circumstances 
will ever radically change a man. If a man has the instinct of research in 
him, it will always show itself in some form. But circumstances may direct it 
into new paths, or may foster it so that what would otherwise have died as a 
bud now blossoms and ripens into the perfect fruit.

Americans have shown no lack of invention in small things; and the same 
spirit, when united to knowledge and love of science, becomes the spirit of 
research. The telegraph-operator, with his limited knowledge of electricity 
and its laws, naturally turns his attention to the improvement of the only 
electrical instrument he knows any thing about; and his researches would be 
confined to the limited sphere of his knowledge, and to the simple laws with 
which he is acquainted. But as his knowledge increases, and the field broadens 
before him, as he studies the mathematical theory of the subject, and the 
electro-magnetic theory of light loses the dim haze due to distance, and 
becomes his constant companion, the telegraph-instrument becomes to him a toy, 
and his effort to discover something new becomes research in pure science.

It is useless to attempt to advance science until one has mastered the 
science: he must step to the front before his blows can tell in the strife. 
Furthermore, I do not believe anybody can be thorough in any department of 
science, without wishing to advance it. In the study of what is known, in the 
reading of the scientific journals, and the discussions therein contained of 
the current scientific questions, one would obtain an impulse to work, even 
though it did not before exist. And the same spirit which prompted him to seek 
what was already known, would make him wish to know the unknown. And I may say 
that I never met a case of thorough knowledge in my own science, except in the 
case of wellknown investigators. I have met men who talked well, and I have 
sometimes asked myself why they did not do something; but further knowledge of 
their character has shown me the superficiality of their knowledge. I am no 
longer a believer in men who could do something if they would, or would do 
something if they had a chance. They are impostors. If the true spirit is 
there, it will show itself in spite of circumstances.

As I remarked before, the investigator in pure science is usually a professor. 
He must teach as well as investigate. It is a question which has been discussed 
in late years, as to whether these two functions would better be combined in 
the same individual, or separated. It seems to be the opinion of most, that a 
certain amount of teaching is conducive, rather than otherwise, to the spirit 
of research. I myself think that this is true, and I should myself not like to 
give up my daily lecture. But one must not be overburdened. I suppose that the 
true solution, in many cases, would be found in the multiplication of assistants, 
not only for the work of teaching but of research. Some men are gifted with 
more ideas than they can work out with their own hands, and the world is 
losing much by not supplying them with extra hands. Life is short: old age 
comes quickly, and the amount one pair of hands can do is very limited. What 
sort of shop would that be, or what sort of factory, where one man had to do 
all the work with his own hands? It is a fact in nature, which no democracy 
can change, that men are not equal, -- that some have brains, and some hands. 
And no idle talk about equality can ever subvert the order of the universe.

I know of no institution in this country where assistants are supplied to aid 
directly in research. Yet why should it not be so? And even the absence of 
assistant professors and assistants of all kinds, to aid in teaching, is very 
noticeable, and must be remedied before we can expect much.

There are many physical problems, especially those requiring exact measurements, 
which cannot be carried out by one man, and can only be successfully attacked 
by the most elaborate apparatus, and with a full corps of assistants. Such are 
Regnault's experiments on the fundamental laws of gases and vapors, made 
thirty or forty years ago by aid from the French government, and which are the 
standards to this day. Although these experiments were made with a view to the 
practical calculation of the steam-engine, yet they were carried out in such a 
broad spirit that they have been of the greatest theoretical use. Again, what 
would astronomy have done without the endowments of observatories? By their 
means, that science has become the most perfect of all branches of physics, as 
it should be from its simplicity. There is no doubt, in my mind, that similar 
institutions for other branches of physics, or, better, to include the whole 
of physics, would be equally successful. A large and perfectly equipped 
physical laboratory with its large revenues, its corps of professors and 
assistants, and its machine-shop for the construction of new apparatus, would 
be able to advance our science quite as much as endowed observatories have 
astronomy. But such a laboratory should not be founded rashly. The value will 
depend entirely on the physicist at its head, who has to devise the plan, and 
to start it into practical work- ing. Such a man will always be rare, and 
cannot always be obtained. After one had been successfully started, others 
could follow; for imitation requires little brains.

One could not be certain of getting the proper man every time, but the means 
of appointment should be most carefully studied so as to secure a good 
average. There can be no doubt that the appointment should rest with a 
scientific body capable of judging the highest work of each candidate.

Should any popular element enter, the person chosen would be either of the 
literary-scientific order, or the dabbler on the outskirts who presents his 
small discoveries. in the most theatrical manner. What is required is a man of 
depth, who has such an insight into physical science that he can tell when 
blows will best tell for its advancement.

Such a grand laboratory as I describe does not exist in the world, at present, 
for the study of physics. But no trouble has ever been found in obtaining 
means to endow astronomical science. Everybody can appreciate, to some extent, 
the value of an observatory; as astronomy is the simplest of scientific 
subjects, and has very quickly reached a position where elaborate instruments 
and costly computations are necessary to further advance. The whole domain of 
physics is so wide that workers have hitherto found enough to do. But it 
cannot always be so, and the time has even now arrived when such a grand 
laboratory should be founded. Shall our country take the lead in this matter, 
or shall we wait for foreign countries to go be- fore? They will be built in 
the future, but when and how is the question.

Several institutions are now putting up laboratories for physics. They are 
mostly for teaching, and we can expect only a comparatively small amount of 
work from most of them. But they show progress; and, if the progress be as 
quick in this direction as in others, we should be able to see a great change 
before the end of our lives.

As stated before, men are influenced by the sympathy of those with whom they 
come in contact. It is impossible to immediately change public opinion in our 
favor; and, indeed, we must always seek to lead it, and not be guided by it. 
For pure science is the pioneer who must not hover about cities and civilized 
countries, but must strike into unknown forests, and climb the hitherto 
inaccessible mountains which lead to and command a view of the promised land, 
-the land which science promises us in the future; which shall not only flow 
with milk and honey, but shall give us a better and more glorious idea. of 
this wonderful universe. We must create a public opinion in our favor, but it 
need not at first be the general public. We must be contented to stand aside, 
and see the honors of the world for a time given to our inferiors; and must be 
better contented with the approval of our own consciences, and of the very few 
who are capable of judging our work, than of the whole world beside. Let us 
look to the other physicists, not in our own town, not in our own country, but 
in the whole world, for the words of praise which are to encourage us, or the 
words of blame which are to stimulate us to renewed effort. For what to us is 
the praise of the ignorant? Let us join together in the bonds of our scientific 
societies, and encourage each other, as we are now doing, in the pursuit of 
our favorite study; knowing that the world will some time recognize our 
services, and knowing, also, that we constitute the most important element in 
human progress.

But danger is also near, even in our societies. When the average tone of the 
society is low, when the highest honors are given to the mediocre, when 
third-class men are held up as examples, and when trifling inventions are 
magnified into scientific discoveries, then the influence of such societies is 
prejudicial. A young scientist attending the meetings of such a society soon 
gets perverted ideas. To his mind, a molehill is a mountain, and the mountain 
a molehill. The small inventor or the local celebrity rises to a greater 
height, in his mind, than the great leader of science in some foreign land. He 
gauges himself by the molehill, and is satisfied with his stature; not knowing 
that he is but an atom in comparison with the mountain, until, perhaps, in old 
age, when it is too late. But, if the size of the mountain had been seen at 
first, the young scientist would at least have been stimulated in his endeavor 
to grow.

We cannot all be men of genius; but we can, at least, point them out to those 
around us. We may not be able to benefit science much ourselves; but we can 
have high ideals on the subject, and instil them into those with whom we come 
in contact. For the good of ourselves, for the good of our country, for the 
good to the world, it is incumbent on us to form a true estimate of the worth 
and standing of persons aud things, and to set before our own minds all that 
is great and good and noble, all that is most important for scientific 
advance, above the mean and low and unimportant.

It is very often said, that a man has a right to his opinion. This might be 
true for a man on a desert island, whose error would influence only himself. 
But when he opens his lips to instruct others, or even when he signifies his 
opinions by his daily life, then he is directly responsible for all his errors 
of judgment or fact. He has no right to think a molehill as big as a mountain, 
nor to teach it, any more than he has to think the world flat, and teach that 
it is so. 'The facts and laws of our science have not equal importance, 
neither have the men who cultivate the science achieved equal results. One 
thing is greater than another, and we have no right to neglect the order. Thus 
shall our minds be guided aright, and our efforts be toward that which is the 
highest.

Then shall we see that no physicist of the first class has ever existed in 
this country, that we must look to other countries for our leaders in that 
subject, and that the few excellent workers in our country must receive many 
accessions from without before they can constitute an American science, or do 
their share in the world's work.

But let me return to the subject of scientific societies. Here American 
science has its hardest problem to contend with. There are very many local 
societies dignified by high-sounding names, each having its local celebrity, 
to whom the privilege of describing some crab with an extra claw, which he 
found in his morning ramble, is inestimable. And there are some academies of 
science, situated at our seats of learning, which are doing good work in their 
locality. But distances are so great that it is difficult to collect men 
together at any one point. The American association, which we are now attending, 
is not a scientific academy, and does not profess to be more than a gathering 
of all who are interested in science, to read papers and enjoy social intercourse. 
The National academy of sciences contains eminent men from the whole country, 
but then it is only for the purpose of advising the government freely on 
scientific matters. It has no building, it has no library; and it publishes 
nothing except the information which it freely gives to the government, which 
does nothing for it in return. It has not had much effect directly on American 
science; but the liberality of the government in the way of scientific 
expeditions, publications, etc., is at least partly due to its influence, and 
in this way it has done much good. But it in no way takes the place of the 
great Royal society, or the great academies of science at Paris, Berlin, 
Vienna, St. Petersburgh, Munich, and, indeed, all the European capitals and 
large cities. These, by their publications, give to the young student, as well 
as the more advanced physicist, models of all that is considered excellent; 
and to become a member is one of the highest honors to which he can aspire, 
while to write a memoir which the academy considers worthy to be published in 
its transactions excites each one to his highest effort.

The American academy of sciences in Boston is perhaps our nearest representation 
of this class of academies, but its limitation of membership to the State 
deprives it of its national character. But there is another matter which 
influences the growth of our science.

As it is necessary for us still to look abroad for our highest inspiration in 
pure science, and as science is not an affair of one town or one country, but 
of the whole world, it becomes us all to read the current journals of science 
and the great transactions of foreign societies, as well as those of our own 
countries. These great transactions and journals should be in the library of 
every institution of learning in the country, where science is taught. How can 
teachers and professors be expected to know what has been discovered in the 
past, or is being discovered now, if these are not provided? Has any institution 
a right to mentally starve the teachers whom it employs, or the students who 
come to it? There can be but one answer to this; and an institution calling 
itself a university, and not having the current scientific journals upon its 
table or the transactions of societies upon its library-shelves, is certainly 
not doing its best to cultivate all that is best in this world.

We call this a free country, and yet it is the only one where there is a 
direct tax upon the pursuit of science. The low state of pure science in our 
country may possibly be attributed to the youth of the country; but a direct 
tax, to prevent the growth of our country in that subject, cannot be looked 
upon as other than a deep disgrace. I refer to the duty upon foreign books and 
periodicals. In our science, no books above elementary ones have ever been 
published, or are likely to be published, in this country; and yet every 
teacher in physics must have then, not only in the college library, but on his 
own shelves, and must pay the government of this country to allow him to use a 
portion of his small salary to buy that which is to do good to the whole 
country. All freedom of intercourse which is necessary to foster our growing 
science is thus broken off; and that which might, in time, relieve our country 
of its mediocrity, is nipped in the bud by our government, which is most 
liberal when appealed to directly on scientific subjects.

One would think that books in foreign languages might be admitted free; but to 
please the half-dozen or so workmen who reprint German books, not scientific, 
our free intercourse with that country is cut off. Our scientific associations 
and societies must make themselves heard in this matter, and show those in 
authority how the matter stands.

In conclusion, let me say once more, that I do not believe that our country is 
to remain long in its present position. The science of physics, in whose 
applications our country glories, is to arise among us, and make us respected 
by the nations of the world. Such a prophecy may seen rash with regard to a 
nation which does not yet do enough physical work to support. a physical 
journal. But we know the speed with which we advance in this country: we see 
cities Springing up in a night, and other wonders performed at an unprecedented 
rate. And now we see physical laboratories being built, we see a great demand 
for thoroughly trained physicists, who have not shirked their mathematics, 
both as professors and in so-called practical life; and perhaps we have the 
feeling, common to all true Americans, that our country is going forward to a 
glorious future, when we shall lead the world in the strife for intellectual 
prizes as we now do in the strife for wealth.

But if this is to be so, we must not aim low.. The problems of the universe 
cannot be solved without labor: they cannot be attacked without the proper 
intellectual as well as physical tools; and no physicist need expect to go far 
without his mathematics. No one expects a horse to win in a great and long 
race who has not been properly trained; and it would be folly to attempt to 
win with one, however pure his blood and high his pedigree, without it. The 
problems we solve are more difficult than any race: the highest intellect 
cannot hope to succeed without proper preparation. The great prizes are 
reserved for the greatest efforts of the greatest intellects, who have kept 
their mental eye bright and flesh hard by constant exercise. Apparatus can be 
bought with money, talents may come to us at birth; but our mental tools, our 
mathematics, our experimental ability, our know|- edge of what others have 
done before us, all have to be obtained by work. The time is almost past, even 
in our own country, when third-rate men can find a place as teachers, because 
they are unfit for every thing else. We wish to see brains and learning, 
combined with energy and immense working-power, in the professor's chair; but, 
above all, we wish to see that high and chivalrous spirit which causes one to 
pursue his idea in spite of all difficulties, to work at the problems of 
nature with the approval of his own conscience, and mot of men before him. Let 
him fit himself for the struggle with all the weapons which mathematics and 
the experience of those gone before him can furnish, and let him enter the 
arena with the fixed and stern purpose to conquer. Let him not be contented to 
stand back with the crowd of mediocrity, but let him press forward for a front 
place in the strife.

The whole universe is before us to study. The greatest labor of the greatest 
minds has only given us a few pearls; and yet the limitless ocean, with its 
hidden depths filled with diamonds and precious stones, is before us. The 
problem of the universe is yet unsolved, and the mystery involved in one 
single atom yet eludes us. The field of research only opens wider and wider as 
we advance, and our minds are lost in wonder and astonishment at the grandeur 
and beauty unfolded before us. Shall we help in this grand work, or not? Shall 
our country do its share, or shall it still live in the almshouse of the 
world?

为纯科学呼吁(A Plea for Pure Science)

有时我们会被问及这样的问题:你最喜欢一年中的哪段时光?对我来说，春天最令人愉快，大自然从冷漠的
冬天中苏醒，生命的力量又开始涌动，树叶生长，蓓蕾绽放，眼前的一切生机盎然，令人赏心悦目。在
这大自然生命复苏的时刻，我们的心也为之狂喜，但是美景不会永恒，叶子会到达它生命的极限，花蕾
盛开后就会走向枯萎。于是，我们开始问自己这样的问题:这一切是否最终都归于虚无，或者它会带来丰

在它的成长过程中，我们这个伟大的国家也有着春天般无以匹敌的勃勃生机。森林被砍伐，城市被建立，
一个伟大而强盛的国家在地球上被创造出来。我们为自己的进步而骄傲，为这些新生的城市而骄傲，因

惊叹，但叶子毕竟是叶子，花终究是花。我们更应该向前看，去发现这些繁荣的结果是什么，收获的机
会是什么。如果我们及时地这样做，那么我们也许能发现那些威胁果实成熟的害虫，或者看到收获正因
缺水而受到摧毁的贫瘠的土地。

**为了应用科学，科学本身必须存在**

我应邀在今年AAAS年会的物理学分会上作报告。我乐意在这个题目上讲让您们高兴的事，我乐意向您们
列举我的同胞们在此领域所取得的进步，他们为认识宇宙的秩序而付出了巨大的努力。但是，当我走出
去收集等待收割的谷物时，我发现的却只是杂草，杂草丛中散落着一些鹤立鸡群的高贵谷穗，它们是如
此之少，以至我的大多数同胞并不了解这些现状，还以为他们有一场大丰收，而实际上最终等待他们收
获的不过是杂草。美国的科学只存在未来，它没有今天和过去。在我这个位置上的人应该思考的问题是
:我们必须要做些什么才能创造出我国的物理学，而不是把电报机、电灯和其它的便利设施称之为科学。
我并不是想低估所有这些东西的价值，世界的进步需要依靠它们，成功发明这些东西的人应该受到世界
的尊重。但是，虽然一位厨师发明了餐桌上的一道新鲜的美味佳肴，使世人在某种程度上享受到了口福，
但是，我们并不会尊称他为化学家。但是，人们将应用科学与纯科学混为一谈并不是罕见之事，特别是
在美国的报纸上，一些卑微的美国人偷取过去伟大人物的思想，通过这些思想在日常生活中的应用让自
己富裕，他们得到的赞美高于那些提出这些思想的伟大原创者，如果这些原创者思想中有一些庸俗成分，
他们早就可以做出成百种这样的应用。我时常被问及这样的问题:纯科学与应用科学究竟哪个对世界更重
要。为了应用科学，科学本身必须存在。假如我们停止科学的进步而只留意科学的应用，我们很快就会
退化成中国人那样，多少代人以来他们都没有什么进步，因为他们只满足于科学的应用，却从来没有追
问过他们所做事情中的原理。这些原理就构成了纯科学。中国人知道火药的应用已经若干世纪，如果他
们用正确的方法探索其特殊应用的原理，他们就会在获得众多应用的同时发展出化学，甚至物理学。因
为只满足于火药能爆炸的事实，而没有寻根问底，中国人已经远远落后于世界的进步，以至于我们现在
只将这个所有民族中最古老、人口最多的民族当成野蛮人。然而，我们的国家也正处于同样的状况。不
过，我们可以做得更好，因为我们获得了欧洲世界的科学，并将它们应用到生活的方方面面。我们就像
接受从天空中落下的雨水那样理所应当地接过这些科学知识，既不问它们究竟从哪里来，也没有感激为
我们提供这些知识的伟大、无私的人们的恩情。就像天堂之雨一样，纯科学降临到我们的国家，让我们
的国家更加伟大、富裕和强壮。

对于今天已经文明化的一个国家来说，科学的应用是必需的。迄今为止，我们的国家在这条路上走得很
成功，因为纯科学在世界上的某些国家中存在并得到培养，对自然的科学研究在这些国家中被尊敬为高
贵的追求，但这样的国家实在稀少。在我国，希望从事纯科学研究的人必须以更多的道德勇气来面对公
众的舆论，他们必须接受被每一位成功的发明家所轻视的可能。在这些发明家肤浅的思想中，这些人以
为人类唯一的追求就是财富，那些拥有最多财富的人就是世界上最成功的人。每个人都理解100万美元的
意义，但能够理解科学理论进展的人却屈指可数，特别是对科学理论中最抽象的部分。我相信这是只有
极少数人献身于人类至高的科学事业的原因之一，因为人是社会动物，他们的幸福感非常依赖于周围人
的认同，只有极少数的人有勇气追求自己的梦想而不在乎所处的环境。过去的人们比现在更为与世隔绝，
一个人只和少数几个人交往，因此，那时的人们有时间创造出伟大的雕塑、绘画和诗歌，每个人的思想
都可以相对自由地追随自己的想法，结果就成就了古代大师们伟大、非凡的作品。今天的铁路、电报、
书籍和报纸将世界各地的每个人联结起来，他的思想不再是个人的，不再是独立和独特的，它要受到外
部世界的影响，并依赖于外部世界，因此在极大的程度上失去了原创性。按照今天的标准，过去的天才
在精神上和物质上可能都非常贫乏，因此，周围弥漫着的傲慢的建议告诉他如何使其外表与自己的身份
相符。他从来没有新想法，但他至少能吸收他人的思想来填充自己苍白的精神世界，所以，这位过去时
代的天才很快就意识到自己的思想比别人高得太多而不为世人所尊重，于是他的思想被裁剪成标准形式，
所有新生的分支被压制，直到他不再高于他周围的人。从此，世界通过这种过多的交流降低到同一个水
平。过去的陆地拥有我们今天无法欣赏到的高耸入云的大山和幽暗的深谷，它们安静、平和，构成了伟
大壮丽的陆上风景。如今，深谷被填充，高山被削平，随风起伏的麦浪和冒烟的工厂成为大地上的风景。
在普通人看来，这是好的变化，较之以往，人们的生活更快乐，精神状态更好，但我们却失去了高山赋
予的气势。我们厌倦平庸，这是我们国家所遭受的诅咒。我们希望这个国家在平庸之上尚有更崇高和尊
贵的东西，一座高山也能让风景不再单调而沉闷。我们被奥秘所包围，大自然赋予了我们情感去享受这
些奥秘，赋予我们理智去揭开这些奥秘。大自然呼唤着我们去研究它，我们更好的感悟力也促使我们走
向这同一方向。

多少代以来，只有少数学习科学的学生将对自然的研究珍视为最崇高的追求，无论富裕或者贫穷，他们
都有一个共同点:对自然及其规律充满热爱。世界因科学的应用而带来的进步应归功于这少数人，但他们
中只有极少数曾从世人那里得到他们应有的回报。法拉弟(Faraday Michael，1791-1867，英国物理
学、化学家，1831年发现电磁感应现象并提出相应理论，后被麦克斯维和爱因斯坦进一步发展)是所有电
光机器、电气铁路、电力传输等基本原理的伟大发现者，尽管整个世界因他的发现而富裕，但他却死于
贫困，这也是今后一段时期中跟随他脚步的人必将面对的命运。但是，未来还是有因纯粹热爱而研究自
然的人，以前人们未曾获得过的更崇高的奖赏在等待着他们。我们已经开始追求科学，站在门槛上想知
道里面究竟有什么。我们通过重力定律解释了行星的运动，但是谁将解释是什么样的力量让两个相隔数
百万英里的天体彼此相向运动呢?今天，我们能够非常容易地测量电量和电流，但是我们有方法来解释电
的现象吗?光是波动的，但我们知道波动的是什么吗?热是一种运动，但我们知道运动着的是什么吗?普通物
质随处可见，但是谁探究出了其内部组成的奥秘呢?

应该说，所有参与工作的人都有机会，竞赛已经开始，但问题的解决不是一蹴而就的事，它需要在不确
定的时间里，由最优秀的头脑做出最好的工作。

当其它国家在竞赛中领先时，我们国家能满足于袖手旁观吗?难道我们总是匍匐在尘土中去捡富人餐桌上
掉下来的面包屑，并因为我们有更多的面包屑而认为自己比他更富裕吗?但我们忘记了这样的事实:他拥有
面包，这是所有面包屑的来源。难道我们卑贱如猪，认为谷粒和谷壳的价值比珍珠高得多吗?如果我对时
代的认识是正确的，那么我认为我们不应该满足于我们低下的地位。目标低下使我们几乎变成了瞎子，
但这是可以恢复的。在一个新国家中，生存的需求是首先需要关注的事情。

但是，让整个世界更轻松地生活是应用科学的使命。我读到过这样一个故事，它阐明了应用科学在世界
上的真实地位。在蒸气机时代的早期，一个热爱阅读甚于工作的男孩获得了一份工作，他的职责是在每
次引擎运动时开关阀门。男孩的阅读被他的工作所打乱，他很快发现通过将阀门与引擎的活动部分联结
起来，让活塞的运动带动阀门的运动，他就能从工作中解脱出来。这个故事说明需求是发明之母，所以
我认为人类真正的追求是智慧。对自然所有分支的科学研究，对数学的研究，对人类过去和现在的研究，
对艺术的追求，以及对所有这些事业的培育是这个世界上最伟大、最高贵的事业，它们是人类最高级的
职业。对有更高理想的人来说，商业、科学的应用和财富的积累是一种诅咒，但对世界上那些没有能力
从事和鉴赏崇高追求的人来说，却是一种祝福。

**从事纯科学研究需要高贵的精神品质**

随着科学应用的日益增加，生活变得越来越容易，购买仪器所必须的经费也不难获得，追求生存之外的
其它东西成为了可能。但是，在能够更多地从事纯科学之前，精神品质的培育应该与国家财富的增长相
平衡。通过合法的专业工作，成功的雕塑家或画家自然能够获得财富；对小说家、诗人和音乐家们来说，
职业成功就意味着财富。但是，科学家们和数学家们却从未有过这种对工作的动力，他们必须通过做其
它工作如教学等来维持生活，只能将业余时间奉献给对科学的追求。通常情况是，因为所挣得的薪水少
得可怜，因为仪器设备和资料文献的匮缺，因为他们所处的精神环境，而更重要的是因为生活理想不高，
他们被迫将自己的业余时间花在给应用科学或其它增加财富的手段上。那么，我们该怎样兑现对那些少
数人中的少数人的尊敬呢?尽管也面临所有这些现实困难，他们仍然坚定不移地认定目标，持之以恒地从
事纯科学研究，为这个世界做出最珍贵的贡献。他们创造的伟大知识丰富了我们对宇宙的认识，当这些
知识被应用到物质生活时，成千上万人的生活更加富裕，我们中的每个人都受益于此。也有这样一些人，
他们拥有从事纯科学研究所需的所有设施，他们拥有丰厚的薪水以及每一件工作仪器，但却全力投入了
商业性的工作，他们到法院作证，去做其它可增加现有丰厚收入的工作。如果这些人放弃教授的头衔，
而冠之以化学顾问专家或物理学顾问专家的称谓，那么他们是值得受到尊重的，我们的社会确实需要这
样的人。但是，如果一个人拥有最著名大学的教授席位，而他的精力和能力却用在科学知识的商业化应
用上，他以尊贵的身份出现在社区，在报纸又成为科学的解释者，那么这对他和他所在的学院来说都是
一种耻辱。这是对其所在科学事业的致命打击。给他以恰如其分的称谓，他马上就会成为这个社会中有
用的一员。将一个按规则并能以身作则培育科学的人放在他的职位上，结果会多么的不同!那些正在世上
寻找生活目标的年轻人，看到他们眼前这个高尚和高贵的人生，他们就会发现世界上还比积累财富更为
尊贵的东西，于是他们就愿意将生命奉献给相同的事业，他们就会尊重那些将他们引向更高境界的教授，
这一境界是他们通过其它途径所不能企及的。

我并不想在这个问题上被误解。因发明而获得财富或者在某些情况下从事商业化的科学工作并不是一件
有失体面的事。但是，纯科学应该是具有教授职位的人的追求目标，这个目标之伟大是毫无疑问的。如
果我们生活的目标是追求财富，那就让我们诚实地从事商业，与他人竞争财富，但是如果我们选择了我
们认为更崇高的事业，那么就说到做到，无论贫富都随遇而安，二者都不能改变既定的追求。

**教育的目的是促进科学进步**

教学工作会消耗大部分精力，这也是绝大多数在教授职位上不进行任何科学工作的人的一个借口，但是
常言道“有志者事竟成”。很少本国教授所承担的教学或演讲工作像德国教授那么繁重，后者却以在科
学期刊上发表详细阐述、精心写作的论文而著名。我自己也肩负教育工作，深知这意味着什么，然而，
在这里我仍然坚持认为，只要您愿意，您就会找出时间来做科学研究。但是，在这里我们依然无法逃避
这个国家的诅咒:平庸。我们的学院和大学很少寻找有声誉的一流水平人士，我甚至听说过这样的事，一
所知名学院的董事曾经声称教授不需要做研究，因为这是浪费时间。我高兴地看到在该学院的优秀科学
家的呼吁下，该董事会的大多数董事都不认可这位董事的观点。

毫无疑问，教学工作是重要的。一位成功的教师应该受到尊重，但是，如果他没有引导学生向最高方向
努力，难道他不该受到谴责吗?我们国家的绝大多数纯科学都是在大学和学院中进行的，但据统计表明，
美国有380或者400左右的机构称自己为学院或大学，而只有16所学院和大学的投入金额达到或超过了50万，
其中只有一半的基金达到或超过了100万。在世界上将一所经费不足100万美元的机构称为大学实在荒唐，
然而我们有100多所这样的机构就是以这样的方式滥用了“大学”之名，实际上它们中的大多数是值得尊
敬的学院。当然，这类事情只会存在于一个民主的国家，它所自豪的是将所有的东西都降低到了同一层
次。或者说，这类事情只可能存在于这样一个民主国家的早期，因为明智的公众很快就会发现:一个错误
的称谓并不能改变事物本身的性质，这一真理才是我们应该告诉这个国家的青年人最为重要的事情。人
们也许会争辩说，所有这些机构在教育方面都做出了好的工作，许多负担不起学院和大学费用的年轻人
在这里接受教育。我并不反对教育，我所反对的是降低我们国家年轻人的理想。要让他们知道他们正在
上的是一所学校而不是一所大学；要让他们知道学校之上是学院，学院之上是大学；要让他们知道他们
只接受了一半的教育，他们与世界上的一些人相比如原子般微不足道。换句话说，他们应该被告知真相。

教师是一个受尊重的职位，但这个职位不会因一个假定的错误头衔而变得更为崇高。而且，头衔越多，
越容易获得，它就越没有值得追求的价值。当教授职位的工作和能力有明确要求时，当教授被要求要跟
上所在领域的发展并要尽全力促进领域的发展时，特别是当他因这些原因而被选出时，那么教授就是一
个值得为之努力争取的职位，成功的竞争者就会得到相应的尊重。骑士精神促使法拉弟将生命奉献给对
自然的研究，这一精神也将激励少数高贵的人们将他们的生命奉献给科学事业，但是如果我们希望在科
学界培育这种最高级的人才，那么我们必须向他们展示一个他们值得为之出付出的事业。

在这个国家中，并不是那些拿最高薪水并在最富裕的大学拥有职位的人最大程度地促进了其所在学科的
进步，那些拿最高薪水并拥有教授职位的人今天所做的事绝对不是纯科学研究，而是科学知识的商业应
用，目的是增加他们已经很高的收入。如前所述，在恰当的职位上做这种追求是值得尊重的，但是教授
的职责是促进科学的进步，他应该向学生和世界展示一个完全、真实的献身科学的榜样，告诉他们生命
中还有更崇高的价值。货币兑换者常常是受人尊重的人，但是耶酥曾经严厉地谴责他们在教堂的大厅中
进行交易。

财富不能成就大学，大楼也不能，大学是由教授和跟随他们学习的学生们构成的。大学是少数学生能够
踏入的最后和最高一步，之后，他走向世界，他在大学里有意或无意感受到的理想会影响他今后所能达
到的高度。如果他跟随的教授在其职业中一直处于很高的地位，自己又有崇高的理想；如果这些教授认
为促进所在领域的进步是他们生命中最重要的工作，并因其智慧而受到全世界的尊重，那么这位学生就
会被引向最高处，甚至在他今后的一生中他都有更高的理想。但是，如果这位学生被一些当时所谓的好
老师所教育，这些老师所知道的只比学生多一点，并常常被学生超过甚至轻视，那么没有人会怀疑这位
学生的品味低下。这位学生发现只要他稍加努力，他就能超过他所在的大学中拥有最高荣誉的人，于是
他开始认为自己是一个天才，工作的动力随之消失了，旁边的小土丘让他感到自己是一个伟大的人，但
他不知道世界上还有他无法比拟的大山。

一所大学的老师队伍中不仅要有伟大的人，而且还要有无数的各类小教授和助理，并要鼓励他们从事最
高级的工作，不为别的原因，而是为了鼓励学生们要尽他们最大的努力。但是，假如这位教授有高尚的
理想，拥有大而且高级的大学所给他掌握的财富，那么，他就有充分发展其才能的机会。

**社会应集中力量为科学研究提供必要的条件**

当然，现在仍然可以用最简单的设备做很多事情，除了完全不胜任者，没有任何人会因为缺少设备而停
止工作。但是现实却是这样的，只有当一个人不仅拥有完整的实验室，而且还有一位可以为他支付每一
个实验费用的朋友时，他才可能自由地在所有的化学和物理学科中做研究。物理系中最简单的部门如天
文学已经达到了这样一种状态:如果没有装备完善的天文台，研究人员基本上什么都不能做，而且如果没
有经费聘请一批实施观测和计算的助手，这一切也是没有用的。我们国家拥有许多非常好的天文台，然
而相比而言所做的工作却太少了，如果将财富集中，也许可以有一个更有效率的天文台，而且将会证明
这对天文科学发展更有利。相反，这些经费分散在六、七个地方，仅能够为附近地区的人们提观测月亮
的望远镜。

我们必须要让这个国家感觉到对研究和纯科学的需求；我们必须要让那些完全献身科学的人们活着，所
有的人都看到我们争取钱，但并不是因为要依靠慈善施舍懒惰度日，而是为了这样的一个事业，较之于
其它任何学问，这个事业在知识上和物质上已经并将更多地促进世界的进步；我们必须这样生活，以消
除那些损害了职业尊严的高位者的影响，或者是那些让自己轻松过日子却没有为其所代表的学科做一点
事的人的影响。让我们在目前能力所及的范围内做一切可能的事情。今天，我们中没有一个人拥有完全
适合的位置足以让他充分发挥能力，允许他做最好的科学。所有的人都有困难，但我不相信环境会从根
本上改变一个人，如果一个人对研究有一种直觉，它总会以某种方式表现出来。但是，环境也许会将它
带上新的征途，或许会给它以哺育，否则它可能会在含苞待放时死去，而不是像现在繁花盛开并结出完
美的果实。

在这个国家里，我没有发现一个机构设有直接辅助研究的助理。那么为什么不这样做呢?甚至缺乏助理教
授和其它各类助理来帮助教学也是非常明显的问题，这类问题必须得以补救。还有许多物理学问题，特
别是那些一个人无法完成的需要精确测量的工作，要完成这些工作需要配备精良的设备和完整的助手队
伍。就像捐赠的天文台促进天文学发展一样，一个经费充足、配备有教授和助手队伍，以及能够建造新
设备的机械工厂的大型、装备完善的物理实验室，同样能够促进物理学的进步。但是，这种实验室不能
草率建成，它的价值完全取决于担任实验室负责人的物理学家，他要制定计划，并通过实际的工作来启
动研究。这样的人总是很稀少的，而且不一定总能找得到。当然，我们不可能每次都想当然地得到适合
的人，但必须对任命方法进行仔细研究，以保证能够具有很好的平均水平。毫无疑问，任命必须由能够
判断每位候选者最高水平工作的科学团体来决定，如果有任何普通的因素加入进来，那么选出的人或者
只是对科学有一定了解的人，或者就是在科学的边缘有所涉猎却会以最夸张的方式展示自己小小发现的
人。我们所需要的是有深度的人，他对物质科学具有深刻见解，能够分辨什么时候能够对科学进展以最
关键的一击。

到目前为止，世界上还没有我所描述的这种伟大的物理实验室，但天文科学在获得捐赠方面却从来都没
有什么困难，每个人都会或多或少地认可天文台的价值，因为天文学是最简单明了的科学学科，很快就
能拥有精致的仪器和昂贵的计算，这是促进天文学发展所必需的。物理学天地是如此之广阔，以至到今
天研究人员还能发现许多可以做的事情。但是情况并非总是如此，现在已经到了需要建造大型实验室的
时刻，在这个问题上我们国家是起领导作用呢，还是等着让其它国家走在前面?未来肯定会建立这样的实
验室，但问题是什么时候建以及如何建。

几个研究机构正在设立物理实验室，它们主要将用于教学，可以想象其中绝大多数实验室只可能产生出
很少的工作，但是它们显示了进步，如果这种进步的速度如其它方面一样快，那么我们就能够想象在我
们的有生之年能够看到巨大的变化。

**树立崇高理想，攀登科学高峰**

人们总是惯于受到所接触的人的认同的影响，不可能立即按有利于我们的发展的方向转化，因此我们必
须努力去引导公众而不是被他们所左右。因为从事纯科学研究者是先驱，他们不可能在城市和已经文明
化的社会中徘徊，他们必须一头扎入未知的森林，攀登迄今无法涉足的高山，在那里俯览希望之乡的美
景。这是科学许诺在未来给我们的乐土，这片土地不仅流淌着奶和蜜，而且赋予我们更好和更伟大的思
想来认识这个神奇的宇宙。

我们必须形成有利于科学发展的公众舆论，但并不一定要从一般大众开始；我们必须满足于站在一旁，
看见世界的荣誉在一段时间里给予水平在我们之下的人；我们必须从自我良心的认可中，以及从极少数
有能力评判我们工作的人们的赞许中得到更良好的满足，而不在乎整个世界在说什么。我们要将目光投
向整个世界的物理学家，而不是本城或本国的物理学家，看看他们是怎么赞美或指责我们。赞美让我们
受到鼓励，指责则刺激我们重新努力。

无知者的赞美对我们有什么用?让我们像正在所做的那样，在我们的科学协会中紧密联系起来，在追求我
们喜爱的研究中彼此相互鼓励。我们知道世界需要时间才能承认我们的服务，我们也知道我们组成了人
类进步最重要的力量。

但即使在我们的科学协会里，危险离我们还是很近的。当协会的平均素质不高，当最高的荣誉给予平庸
之辈，三流水准的人被树立成榜样，微不足道的发明被夸大为科学发现时，这种协会的影响就是有害的，
一位参加这种协会会议的年轻科学家很快就会得到被歪曲的思想。在这位年轻科学家的思想中，小土丘
就是高山，高山反而成为小土丘；在他的头脑中，小小的发明家或当地的某个地方名人会比国际上的科
学领袖还高不可及。他就会用小土丘的标准来衡量自己，对自己状态感到满意，但他不知道与真正的高
山相比，他不过如原子般的大小。或许当他老的时候会明白这一点，但为时已晚!如果在他起步之初就能
看到高山的雄伟，那么这位年轻的科学家至少会在其成长过程中一直受到激励而努力向上。

不是所有的人都是天才，但至少我们能够指引他们向我们身边的天才学习。我们自己也许无法从科学获
得太多的好处，但我们可以有崇高的理想，并将它们逐渐渗透给我们接触到的人们。为了我们自己的幸
福，为了我们国家的富强，为了全世界的利益，我们应该形成一套能够真正衡量人或事的价值和地位的
评价体系，在我们的头脑中把所有高尚、有益和高贵的思想放在前面，把所有对科学发展重要的东西放
在前面，高于那些平庸的、低级的和琐碎的东西，这是我们义不容辞的责任!

人们总是说，一个人有权有自己的观点，对于在荒岛中生活的人来说这种说法也许是对的，因为他的错
误只会影响到他一个人，但是当他的话是用于教导别人时，特别是他的观点影响到他的日常生活时，他
就必须对他在判断或事实方面的所有错误承担直接责任。他没有权利将一个小土丘当作是高山，也不能
这样去教学生，就正如他不能认为地球是平的，并用这一观点来教学生一样。我们所发现的科学事实和
规律的重要性是不一样的，每个研究人员的科学成果的重要性也是不一样的。一件事比另一件事更伟大，
我们没有权力忽视这个秩序。这样，我们的心灵才会被正确地引导，我们的努力才会朝着最高的方向。
因此我们应该看到，这个国家还没有第一流的物理学家，我们必须到其它国家去寻找这个领域的领导，
在他们创建出美国科学或者为世界科学做出贡献前，我国少数杰出的人物必须从无到有得到更多的财富
支持。

美国科学有最棘手的问题需要处理。有太多的地方学会被冠以大而不当的名称，每个学会都有自己的知
名人士，他们有特权将他在早晨散步时发现的某些多出一支脚的螃蟹描述为无价之宝。我们也有一些科
学学会，在求知方面在当地做出很好的工作。但是，路途如此遥远，很难将人们集中到一个地方。今天
我们参加开会的美国科学促进会并不是一个科学机构，也不过是聚集了对科学有兴趣的人，让他们阅读
论文并享受交流的乐趣。美国国家科学院是由整个国家中最杰出的人士组成的，但它的作用只是在科学
问题上为政府提供免费的建议。

还有一个因素影响着我们科学事业的发展，那就是我们必需在纯科学方面从国外寻求最高的灵感，因为
科学不是局限于一个城市或国家的事务，而是整个世界的事业。所以，我们所有的人在阅读自己国家的
期刊时，也必须同时阅读最新的外国科学期刊和最重要的外国协会的学报。我们国家每一个从事科学教
育的机构的图书馆，都必须存放有这些伟大学报和期刊。如果没有提供这些期刊和学报，又怎么能期望
我们的教师或教授知道过去发现过什么，或是了解到现在正在发现些什么呢?哪一所机构有这样的权利让
它所聘请的教师或到此学习的学生们在精神上挨饿?这只能有一个答案:如果一个自称为大学的机构在它的
桌子上没有最新的科学期刊，或者在它的图书馆的书架上没有存放学会的学报，那么可以肯定的是，它
没尽最大的努力来促进和培育这个世界上最好的人和事。

我们称自己的国家是一个自由的国家，然而它却是世界上唯一一个对科学事业直接收税的国家。目前我
国纯科学水平低下或许是因为我们国家很年轻，但是直接向科学收税从而阻止我国科学的成长，却不能
说不是最为丢脸的事，这里我指的是对外国书籍和期刊的征税。在科学方面，我们国家还没有出版过或
者即将出版任何中小学教材以上的书籍，但是，物理学的每一位教师都必须拥有这样的书，不仅是在图
书馆的书架上，而且是在他们自己的书架上。这个国家有责任让这些教师有能力用自己微薄的薪水的一
部分来购买有利于整个国家的书籍。做不到这一点，所有有益于培育我国科学成长的自由交流就会被全
部中断，那些有助于提升我国高于平庸水平的新生事物在萌芽阶段就会被政府窒息，而这一政府在直接
的科学题目上给人的印象好像还是较为宽松自由的。

人们可能以为外文书籍免税进入不过是为了让某些人或重印德国书籍的工人高兴，因此剥夺了我们与德
国进行自由的科学交流的权利。我们的科学协会和社会必须让人们知道自己在此事上的立场，并让当局
明白事情的来龙去脉。

最后，让我再次重申:我不相信我们的国家会长期处于目前的这种状况。物理学的应用让我们国家繁荣富
强，我国物理学正在蒸蒸日上的发展，它会让我们受到世界各国家的尊重。这个预言似乎过于轻率，因
为我们国家所做的物理学工作还不足以支撑一个物理学期刊，但是我们知道这个国家前进的速度。我们
看见了城市在一夜之间拔地而起，其它的宏伟事业也以史无前例的速度前进；我们看见了正在建造的物
理学实验室；我们看见了对接受过全面训练而又不惧怕数学的物理学家的大量需求，需要他们做教授或
加入到所谓的现实生活中。也许我们与所有真正的美国人有着同样的感觉，我们的国家正在走向繁荣昌
盛的未来，我们将努力成为世界科学的领导，就像我们今天努力成为世界财富的领导一样。

如果要实现这样的理想，我们的目标就不能太低。没有辛勤的工作，宇宙的问题就不会被解开；没有一
定数量的知识分子和恰当的物理工具，这些问题就不会被攻克；缺乏数学知识的物理学家不会走得太远。
没有人会期待一匹没有经过良好训练的马能赢得伟大的长距离赛马比赛，同样，无论拥有多么纯正、高
贵的血统，指望没有良好训练的人获得大奖也是大错而特错的，因为我们要解决的问题远比任何竞赛都
更加困难，如果没有恰当的准备，即使最高智力水平的人也不会获得成功。最伟大的奖励等待着伟大的
智力付出最大的努力，他必须通过持续不断的实践来保持敏锐的目光和新鲜的思想。仪器和设备可以用
钱买来，天赋可能与生俱来，但是我们心智的工具，我们的数学知识，我们的实验能力，我们对前人创
造的知识的掌握，所有这些都需要通过努力才能获得。即使是在我们国家，三流水平的人因为什么都不
会做而成为教师的时代也已经过去。我们希望在教授席位上看到这样的人:他们聪明、好学、精力旺盛而
又充满工作动力。但最重要的是，我们希望看到能够激励人们排除万难去追求最高理想的高贵和勇敢的
精神，他们是在自己良知的赞许而不是他人的认可之下去探求自然界的难题。让他们用所有的数学武器、
前人的经验来武装自己，让他们胸怀征服的坚定目标走进这个竞技场，让他们不要满足于站在平庸之辈
的人群后面，让他们在竞争中力争站到最前列。

整个宇宙就在我们面前，等待我们去研究。最伟大的头脑经过最伟大的努力才能给我们带来少量的珍宝，
但是无穷的海洋在我们面前，它隐秘的深谷中充满了钻石和宝石。宇宙的问题还没有解决，即使一个原
子的秘密也还让我们迷惑不已。当我们不断前进时，研究的领域就会越来越宽广，自然的庄严和美丽让
我们惊讶和赞叹。我们能为这些伟大的工作做些什么吗?我们的国家是会承担起自己应有的责任呢?还是只
会生活在世界的施舍中呢?
