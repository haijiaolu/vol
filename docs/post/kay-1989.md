## Predicting The Future

By Alan C. Kay

> Alan C. Kay is a fellow at Apple Computer Inc., a visionary, one of a few select scientists who have an independent charter to pursue far-out ideas. As he explains, his is a job which forbids him to grow up. The following remarks are taken from Kay's address before the 20th annual meeting of the Stanford Computer Forum.

"Xerox PARC (a computer science think tank for which Kay was a founding principal in 1970) was set up in Palo Alto to be as far away from corporate headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut. as possible and still be in the continental U.S. We used to have visits from the Xerox executives--usually in January and February--and when we could get them off the tennis courts they would come into the building at PARC. Mainly they were worried about the future, and they would badger us about what's going to happen to us. Finally, I said: 'Look, the best way to predict the future is to invent it. This is the century in which you can be proactive about the future; you don't have to be reactive. The whole idea of having scientists and technology is that those things you can envision and describe can actually be built.' It was a surprise to them and it worried them."

Another way to predict the future is to realize that it takes a very long time--about 10 to 20 years--to get a technology out of the research lab and into everyday life. It's very difficult to get brand new ideas out in less than a decade; in the case of the transistor, it took almost 25 years. No matter what you do, it may take several companies, several different groups of people, several different areas of venture capital funding and more before you get something back.

As far as predicting the future, that makes it really nice, because it means that a lot of the future that we're going to have to contend with is sitting in someone's research lab right now. And, by simply going around and looking in the right places you can get a tremendous ideas of the kind of things that are going to happen.

Another way to predict the future is best explained by an anecdote in John Dessauer's book. Dessauer was an executive at Haloid Corporation, the tiny company in Rochester, N.Y., that eventually became Xerox where he served as an executive for awhile. His book is called _My Years at Xerox, the Billions Nobody Wanted_.

The story describes how, in 1956, after some years of struggling, Dessauer was able to build the prototype of the 914 plain paper copier. Lacking the money to take the copier to market to build factories and so forth, he decided to take it just down the road to IBM. He told IBM, "Take this, build factories, go out and sell it. I just want a small royalty." And IBM did what all companies do when they can't make up their minds: They went out and hired some consultants.

After an exhaustive study that took 18 months, the consultants came back with a very thick report which conclusively proved that there was no market for a plain paper copier. They had two chief reasons and a host of minor ones. Number one: there wasn't enough copy volume. That was a big problem. The other was that the xerography process cost more than ten-times as much per copy as the AB Dick mimeograph process, which was the technology they compared it against. The consultants figured no one would spend ten times as much to copy anything. So based on their report, IBM turned down the copier offer, and that was several hundreds of billions of dollars ago.

That's a very interesting story because IBM thought that their computer group was not in the communications business, and so did their consultant, and they missed a very important point: Humans beings can't exist without communication. It's one of those basic human traits, and we're always willing to pay more for a better communications amplifier.

Many others have made this mistake. The railroads made a study after WWl which showed that for as far as they could see into the future, aircraft transportation would always be more expensive than railroad transportation. And you know, they're still right today; it's still more expensive. The problem is the railroads are almost gone because nobody cares if air travel is more expensive, they're willing to pay it. The railroad industry missed the idea that not everything is a commodity market, and that price is important, but there are also value markets where people are willing to pay extra for extra value.

### WHERE DO IDEAS COME FROM?

Of various ways of coming up with new ideas, I think the weakest is brainstorming, to take what you've got and try to wedge it together into something, paint it and sell it. Of course you can get a product out of that: Take all the obnoxious things in a 12-year-old's room and glue them together and you get a boom box, which happens to be selling quite well. But most things done by brainstorming are like boom boxes.

The goal-orientated approach that the management books advocate is to find a need and fill it. We don't get many new ideas out of that because if you ask most people what they want, they want just what they have now, 10 percent faster, 10 percent cheaper, with 10 percent more features. It's kind of a boring way to predict the future. But if we look at the big hitters in the 20th century, like the Xerox machine, like the personal computer, like the pocket calculator, all of these things did something else. They weren't contaminations of existing things. They weren't finding a need and filling it. They created a need that only they could fill. Their presence on the scene caused a need to be felt, and almost paradoxically the company was there to create the need and fill the need. That's what the Xerox machine did; nobody needed to copy until the Xerox machine came along. Nobody needed to calculate before the pocket calculator came along. When mini computers and micro computers came in, people said, "What do we need those things for? You can do everything now on the mainframe." And the answer was, "Of course, you can do all those things on the mainframe, but it's for all the extra things you can do that you wouldn't think of doing on the mainframe."

### WHY AREN'T WE BETTER DESIGNERS?

Marshall McLuhan has a line to try to explain some of this: He says, "I don't know who discovered water, but it wasn't a fish."

Part of what he meant is that if you're immersed in the context, you have an extremely difficult time being able to see what's going on. It's been remarked that the Japanese do a better job marketing to us than we do to ourselves, because they know the market through an alien culture. They actually study us in a way that we don't look at ourselves.

Another reason that we don't create very well, is that we're afraid. America for the last 20 or 30 years has been going through a failure of nerve. McLuhan says, "Innovation for holders of conventional wisdom is not novelty but annihilation." That's the way our executives react all too often.

    When we think about the ways that mankind has extended itself over the years, at least for the purposes of this talk, I'd like to think about two major ways: one is through the notion of amplifying tools, something which amplifies our reach into the world. Many of these tools are extensions of the body, like the microscope and telescope; some of them are rhetorical tools. I think of them as better ways to manipulate things.
    The other method is by goal cloning, that is, to convince other people that they should work on our goals rather than theirs. Lewis Mumford wrote a good book about this process called The Myth of the Machine. When you want to build a pyramid, you have to have some tools, but you also have to find ways to convince 10,000 people or 100,000 people to work with you to get the thing done.

I remember in the early days of PARC--during one of the many visits by Xerox executives--when I had just come up with the idea of overlapping windows. We had implemented a test version of it, and I showed this to the executive who was there that day. I wound up the demonstration saying, "What's even better is that this idea only has a 20 percent chance of success; we're taking risks just like you asked us to." And the executive looked me right in the eye, and said, "Boy, that's great, but just make sure it works."

Far too many executives want you to be in that 20 percent, 200 percent of the time. The idea that to have a 20 percent chance of success means that you have to fail four out of five times is totally repugnant to them. I might ask of those here in the Stanford Computer Forum how many of your companies have an award for the best failure each year. Probably none. This is a big problem because people go where the rewards are and the chances of getting something really nifty go down by a considerable amount.

Another problem is that we don't have a very good concept of the future itself. McLuhan's line--one of my favorites--is, "We're driving faster and faster into the future, trying to steer by using only the rear-view mirror."

Whitehead, the British philosopher, remarked that the greatest invention of the 19th century was the invention of invention itself. Not only were there 10 and 20 times more patent applications at the British government patent office, but about 80 percent of those patents were absolutely crackpot ideas. This was the century in which anybody who had an idea thought he could be an inventor and submit a patent for it because everyone else was doing it.

McLuhan had a great line about the 20th century. He said, "The 20th century is the century in which change changed." He was referring back to Heraclitus, the Greek who said, "The only thing constant is change itself." From our standpoint it's hard to see that as a revolutionary statement, but remember that before the Greeks, it was unreasonable for a person to be born into a world, live in a world, and die in a world that was any different from the world in which his parents had lived, or his parents' parents and so forth. Things were pretty much the same for many thousands of years.

But McLuhan was saying something else, that when change changes, you can't predict the future in the same way anymore; you have some second order or third order effects. So the biggest thing we need to invent in the 1990s is the invention of the future itself. In other words, to think of the concept of future not as a thing that comes from the past--although it has come from the past in a way--but to realize that the forces that are bringing about change right now are so great that it's very difficult to sit down and make simple extrapolations.

Science fiction had some ideas about us going to the moon partly because there were some fledgling things called rockets and someone could imagine one big enough to get us here. And science fiction could imagine robots with positronic brains, because Isaac Asimov did not have to explain how positronic brains worked. But science fiction totally missed the idea of the computer. Before the power of the transistor really became apparent there was just no conceivable extrapolation.

In some sense our ability to open the future will depend no on how well we learn anymore but how well we are able to unlearn. Can you imagine a course at Stanford on unlearning? That would be revolutionary. How could we try to subtract the lives that we're living in out of our prognostications?

I think the weakest way to solve a problem is just to solve it; that's what they teach in elementary school. In some math and science courses they often teach you it's better to change the problem. I think it's much better to change the context in which the problem is being stated. Some years ago, Marvin Minsky said, "You don't understand something until you understand it more than one way." I think that what we're going to have to learn is the notion that we have to have multiple points of view.

At PARC we had a slogan: "Point of view is worth 80 IQ points." It was based on a few things from the past like how smart you had to be in Roman times to multiply two numbers together; only geniuses did it. We haven't gotten any smarter, we've just changed our representation system. We think better generally by inventing better representations; that's something that we as computer scientists recognize as one of the main things that we try to do.

## 预测未来（Predicting The Future）

艾伦·凯

> 以下是艾伦·凯（Alan Kay）在斯坦福计算机论坛（Stanford Computer Forum）第 20 届年会上的讲话。（1989 年）

施乐帕洛阿尔托研究中心（Xerox PARC）是一家计算机科学智库，成立于 1970 年（凯是其创始人之一）。我们过去经常接待施乐公司的高管——通常是在每年 1 月和 2 月，他们会来到帕洛阿尔托研究中心的大楼。他们主要担心的是未来，他们会缠着我们，问我们未来会发生什么事。最后，我说：“预测未来的最好方法就是发明它。在这个世纪里，你可以积极面对未来；不必被动。有了科学家和技术，那些你可以想象和描述的东西实际上是可以建造的。”这对他们来说是个惊喜，也让他们担心。

预测未来的另一种方法是认识到，将一项技术从研究实验室引入日常生活需要很长时间，大约 10 到 20 年。要在不到十年的时间里提出全新的想法是非常困难的；就晶体管而言，就持续了近 25 年的时间。无论你做什么，可能需要几家公司、几个不同的群体、几个不同的风险投资，甚至更多投入才能得到回报。

就预测未来而言，这真的很好，因为这意味着很多我们将要面对的未来现在就在某人的研究实验室里。

预测未来的另一种方法，最好的解释是约翰·德萨尔（John H. Dessauer）书中的一则轶事。德萨尔是纽约州罗彻斯特市（Rochester, N.Y.）一家小公司哈罗伊德（Haloid Corporation）的高管，后来这家公司变成了施乐（Xerox），他在施乐担任了一段时间的高管。他的书叫做《My Years at Xerox, the Billions Nobody Wanted》。

这个故事描述了 1956 年，经过几年的努力，德萨尔终于制造出了 914 普通纸复印机的原型机。由于没有足够的资金将复印机推向市场，建造工厂等等，他决定把它带到 IBM 去。他告诉 IBM，“拿着这个，去建工厂，出去卖。我只想要一小笔版税。”IBM 做了所有公司在拿不定主意时都会做的事情：聘请了一些顾问。

经过历时 18 个月的详尽研究，顾问们得出了一份非常厚的报告，最终证明了普通纸复印机是没有市场的。他们有两个主要理由和许多次要理由。第一：没有足够的拷贝量。这是个大问题。另一个原因是，静电复印的成本是 AB 迪克油印机（AB Dick mimeograph）的十倍以上，而 AB 迪克油印机是静电复印技术的竞争对手。顾问们认为，没有人会花十倍的钱去复制任何东西。根据他们的报告，IBM 拒绝了普通纸复印机，这个市场后来达到几千亿美元。

这是一个非常有趣的故事，因为 IBM 认为他们的计算机团队不从事通信业务，他们的顾问也是如此，他们忽略了一个非常重要的问题：没有通信，人类就无法生存。这是人类的基本特征之一，我们总是愿意花更多的钱买一个更好的通讯放大器。

很多人都犯了这个错误。铁路公司在第一次世界大战后做了一项研究，表明就他们所能预见的未来而言，飞机运输总是比铁路运输昂贵。他们今天仍然是对的；飞机运输还是更贵。问题是，铁路几乎消失了，因为没人关心乘飞机旅行是否更贵，他们愿意支付。铁路行业没有意识到，并非一切都是商品市场，价格很重要，但也有价值市场，人们愿意为额外的价值付出额外的代价。

### 点子从何而来？

在想出新点子的各种方式中，我认为最弱的是头脑风暴。当然，你可以从中得到一个产品：把 12 岁孩子房间里所有讨厌的东西放在一起，你就得到了一个东西，碰巧卖得很好。但是头脑风暴做的大多数事情就像这个东西一样。

管理类书籍提倡以目标为导向的方法是发现需求并满足它。我们并没有从中得到很多新的想法，因为如果你问大多数人他们想要什么，他们想要的只是他们现在有的东西，快 10%，便宜 10%，多 10%的功能。这是一种无聊的预测未来的方法。但如果我们看看 20 世纪的新东西，比如复印机，个人电脑，袖珍计算器，所有这些都做了不同的事情。它们并没有找到一个需求并去满足它。它们创造了一种只有它们才能满足的需求。它们的出现引起了人们的需求，而且几乎矛盾的是，公司的存在是为了创造需求和满足需求。施乐机器就是这么做的；在施乐机器出现之前，没有人需要复印。袖珍计算器出现之前，没人需要计算。当迷你计算机和微型计算机出现时，人们说，“我们需要这些东西做什么？你现在可以在大型机上做任何事情。”答案是，“当然，你可以在大型机上做所有这些事情，但你可以用它做不想在大型机上做的其他事情。”

### 为什么我们不是更好的设计师？

马歇尔·麦克卢汉（Marshall McLuhan）有句话试图解释：他说，“我不知道是谁发现了水，但肯定不是鱼。”

他的意思是，如果你沉浸在环境中，你很难看清发生了什么。有人说，日本人在营销方面比我们做得更好，因为他们通过外来文化了解我们的市场。他们实际上以一种我们不看自己的方式研究我们。

我们不善于创造的另一个原因是我们害怕。在过去的二三十年里，美国经历了一次神经衰弱。麦克卢汉说，“对于持有传统观点的人说，创新不是新奇的，而是毁灭。”这是我们的主管们经常做出的反应。

    当我们思考这些年来人类扩展自身的方式时，至少就本次演讲而言，我想考虑两种主要的方式：一是通过放大工具的概念，扩大我们对世界的接触。这些工具很多都是身体的延伸，比如显微镜和望远镜；有些是修辞工具。我认为它们是更好的操作方法。
    另一种方法是通过目标克隆，也就是说，让其他人相信他们应该为我们的目标而不是他们的目标而努力。刘易斯·芒福德（Lewis Mumford）写过一本关于这个过程的好书，名为《机器的神话》（The Myth of Machines）。当你想建造金字塔的时候，你必须有一些工具，但是你也必须想办法说服10，000人或者100，000人和你一起完成这件事。

我还记得在帕洛阿尔托研究中心的早期，施乐公司的高管们多次造访研究中心——当时我刚刚想到重叠窗口的想法。我们已经实现了一个测试版本，我把它展示给那天在场的高管。我结束演示时说，“更好的是，这个想法只有 20%的成功机会；我们正在冒险，就像你让我们做的那样。” 那位主管看着我的眼睛，说：“那很好，但要确保它能正常工作。”

太多的高管希望你在 20%到 200%的时间里都能做到这一点。有 20%的成功机会意味着你必须在五次中失败四次，这种想法完全让他们反感。这是一个很大的问题，因为人们会去做有回报的事情，而不去尝试真正好的事情。

另一个问题是，我们对未来本身没有一个很好的概念。麦克卢汉的一句话——我最喜欢的一句话——是，“我们越来越快地驶向未来，试图仅靠后视镜来控制方向。”

英国哲学家怀特海（Whitehead）曾说，19 世纪最伟大的发明就是发明本身。不仅英国政府专利局的专利申请数量增加了 10 到 20 倍，而且其中 80%的专利都是异想天开的想法。当时，任何有想法的人都认为他可以成为一个发明家，然后为它申请专利，因为其他人都在这么做。

麦克卢汉有一句关于 20 世纪的名言。他说，“20 世纪是变革的世纪。”他指的是赫拉克利特，这个希腊人说，“唯一不变的是变化本身。”从我们的观点来看，这很难被看作是一个革命性的声明，但请记住，在希腊人之前，一个人出生在一个世界，生活在一个世界，然后死在一个与他父母生活的世界或他父母的父母生活的世界不同的世界，这是不合理的。几千年来，情况都差不多。

但麦克卢汉说的是，当变化发生时，你不能再以同样的方式预测未来；你有一些二阶或三阶的效果。所以我们在 20 世纪 90 年代需要发明的最重要的东西就是未来本身的发明。换句话说，不要把未来的概念看作是来自过去的东西——尽管它在某种程度上来自于过去——但是要意识到现在带来改变的力量是如此巨大，以至于很难坐下来进行简单的推断。

科幻小说中有一些关于我们去月球的想法，部分原因是当时有一些叫做火箭的新兴事物，有人可以想象一个足够大的火箭把我们带到月球。科幻小说可以想象拥有“正子脑”的机器人，因为艾萨克·阿西莫夫不需要解释“正子脑”是如何工作的。但科幻小说完全忽略了计算机的概念。在晶体管的力量真正变得明显之前，根本没有可以想象的推断。

从某种意义上说，我们打开未来的能力不再取决于我们如何学习，而是取决于我们如何能够忘却。你能想象斯坦福有一门关于遗忘的课程吗？那将是革命性的。我们怎么能从预测中减去我们现在的生活呢？

我认为解决问题最弱的方法是解决它；那是在小学里教的方法。在一些数学和科学课程中，他们经常告诉你，最好的方法是改变问题。我认为最好的方法是改变问题陈述的背景。几年前，马文·明斯基说，“你只有通过多种方式才能理解一件事。”我认为我们要学习的是我们必须有多种视角。

在帕洛阿尔托研究中心，我们有一个口号：“一个观点值 80 个智商点”。它是基于过去的一些事情，比如在罗马时代你必须有多聪明才能把两个数字相乘；只有天才才这样做。我们并没有变得更聪明，我们只是改变了我们的表现系统。我们通过创造更好的表现来更好地思考；作为计算机科学家，我们认识到这是我们试图做的主要事情之一。
