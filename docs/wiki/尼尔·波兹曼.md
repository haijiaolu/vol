引言
……

“再举个更重要的例子：直到1890年，美国的中学只招收7%的年龄在14岁到17岁的人。[3]另外93%在和许多更加年幼的儿童一起从事着成人的劳动。一些儿童更是日出而作，日落而息，这在各大城市比比皆是。然而，我们首先不能将社会事实和社会概念混为一谈。童年的概念是文艺复兴的伟大发明之一，也许是最具人性的一个发明。童年作为一种社会结构和心理条件，与科学、单一民族的独立国家以及宗教自由一起，大约在16世纪产生，经过不断提炼和培育，延续到我们这个时代。但是像一切社会产物一样，它的持久存在并不是必然的。其实，写作本书的想法起源于我个人的观察，那就是童年正在消逝，而且飞快地消逝。在接下来的章节里，我的任务，一部分是展现童年消逝的证据，证明情况的确如此，尽管我怀疑大多数读者不会要求多少说服就会相信。有关童年消逝的话题，不论我到何处演讲，不论我何时写作，听众和读者不仅没有对这个观点表示异议，而且急不可耐地从自身的经验中为我提供证据。童年和成年的分界线正迅速模糊。这个观察对于关注它的人平淡无奇，对于不关注它的人也不置可否。不甚为人知晓的是，首先童年从何而来。至于为什么童年会消逝，就更鲜为人知了。”

The Disappearance of Childhood

Introduction
...

“To take a more important example: "As late as 1890, American high schools enrolled only seven percent of the fourteen-through seventeen-year-old population.3 Along with many much younger children, the other ninety-three percent worked at adult labor, some of them from sunup to sunset in all of our great cities."
But we must not confuse, at the outset, social facts with social ideas. The idea of childhood is one of the great inventions of the Renaissance. Perhaps its most humane one. Along with science, the nation-state, and religious freedom, childhood as both a social structure and a psychological condition emerged around the sixteenth century and has been refined and nourished into our own times. But like all social artifacts, its continued existence is not inevitable. Indeed, the origin of this book is in my observation that the idea of childhood is disappearing, and at dazzling speed. Part of my task in the pages to come is to display the evidence that this is so, although I suspect most readers will not require much convincing. Wherever I have gone to speak, or whenever I have written, on the subject of the disappearance of childhood, audiences and readers have not only refrained from disputing the point but have eagerly provided me with evidence of it from their own experience. The observation that the dividing line between childhood and adulthood is rapidly eroding is common enough among those who are paying attention, and is even suspected by those who are not. What isn’t so well understood is where childhood comes from in the first place and, still less, why it should be disappearing.”
