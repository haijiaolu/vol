I should have known, as I’ve often quoted Phil Karlton’s wise saying “There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things”.

> Years ago, when my dad Phil Karlton was working at Netscape, he touted a now-infamous phrase:
> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.
> It’s been fun following this quote on the Internet for the past two decades. It’s clearly been so sticky because it’s both funny and true. There have been lots of riffs on it, as well, all of which are delightful. Thanks, Internet.
