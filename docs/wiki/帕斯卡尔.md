我很能想像一个人没有手、没有脚、没有头（因为只是经验才教导我们说，头比脚更为必要）。
然而，我不能想像人没有思想：那就成了一块顽石或者一头畜牲了。

> I can well conceive a man without hands, feet, head (for it is only experience which teaches us that the head is more necessary than feet). But I cannot conceive man without thought; he would be a stone or a brute.

#### 340

教学机器得出的结果，要比动物所做出的一切更接近于思想；
然而它都做不出任何事情可以使我们说，它也具有意志就像动物那样。

> The arithmetical machine produces effects which approach nearer to thought than all the actions of animals. But it does nothing which would enable us to attribute will to it, as to the animals.

#### 344

本能与理智，两种天性的标志。

> Instinct and reason, marks of two natures.

#### 346

思想形成人的伟大。

> Thought constitutes the greatness of man.

#### 347

人只不过是一根苇草，是自然界最脆弱的东西；但他是一根能思想的苇草。
用不着整个宇宙都拿起武器来才能毁灭他；一口气、一滴水就足以致他死命了。
然而，纵使宇宙毁灭了他，人却仍然要比致他于死命的东西更高贵得多；
因为他知道自己要死亡,以及宇宙对他所具有的优势，而宇宙对此却是一无所知。

因而，我们全部的尊严就在于思想。正是由于它而不是由于我们所无法填充的空间和时间，
我们才必须提高自己。因此，我们要努力好好地思想：这就是道德的原则。

> Man is but a reed, the most feeble thing in nature; but he is a thinking reed. The entire universe need not arm itself to crush him. A vapour, a drop of water suffices to kill him. But, if the universe were to crush him, man would still be more noble than that which killed him, because he knows that he dies and the advantage which the universe has over him; the universe knows nothing of this.
>
> All our dignity consists, then, in thought. By it we must elevate ourselves, and not by space and time which we cannot fill. Let us endeavour, then, to think well; this is the principle of morality.

#### 348

能思想的苇草一一我应该追求自己的尊严，绝不是求之于空间，而是求之于自己思想的规定。
我占有多少土地都不会有用；由于空间，宇宙便囊括了我并吞没了我，有如一个质点；
由于思想，我却襄括了宇宙。

> A _thinking reed_.—It is not from space that I must seek my dignity, but from the government of my thought. I shall have no more if I possess worlds. By space the universe encompasses and swallows me up like an atom; by thought I comprehend the world.

#### 352

一个人的德行所能做到的事不应该以他的努力来衡量，而应该以他的日常生活来衡量。

> The strength of a man's virtue must not be measured by his efforts, but by his ordinary life.

#### 354

人性并不是永远前进的，它是有进有退的。

激情是有冷有热的；而冷也像热本身一样显示了激情的热度的伟大。

一个世纪又一个世纪的人们的创作也是一样。世上的好和坏，总的说来，也是一样。
Plerumque gratae principibus vices.

> Man's nature is not always to advance; it has its advances and retreats.
>
> Fever has its cold and hot fits; and the cold proves as well as the hot the greatness of the fire of fever.
>
> The discoveries of men from age to age turn out the same. The kindness and the malice of the world in general are the same. _Plerumque gratae principibus vices_.

#### 358

人既不是天使，又不是禽兽；但不幸就在于想表现为天使的人却表现为禽兽。

> Man is neither angel nor brute, and the unfortunate thing is that he who would act the angel acts the brute.

#### 365

思想——人的全部的尊严就在于思想。

因此，思想由于它的本性，就是一种可惊叹的、无与伦比的东西。
它一定得具有出奇的缺点才能为人所蔑视；然而它又确实具有，所以再没有比这更加荒唐可笑的事了。
思想由于它的本性是何等地伟大啊，思想又由于它的缺点是何等地卑贱啊！

然而，这种思想又是什么呢？它是何等地愚蠢啊！

> _Thought_.—All the dignity of man consists in thought. Thought is therefore by its nature a wonderful and incomparable thing. It must have strange defects to be contemptible. But it has such, so that nothing is more ridiculous. How great it is in its nature! How vile it is in its defects!
>
> But what is this thought? How foolish it is!

#### 396

有两件东西把全部的人性教给了人：即本能和经验。

> Two things instruct man about his whole nature; instinct and experience.

#### 397

人的伟大之所以为伟大，就在于他认识自己可悲。一颗树并不认识自己可悲。

因此，认识〔自己〕可悲乃是可悲的；然而认识我们之所以为可悲，却是伟大的。

> The greatness of man is great in that he knows himself to be miserable. A tree does not know itself to be miserable.
> It is then being miserable to know oneself to be miserable; but it is also being great to know that one is miserable.

#### 398

这一切的可悲其本身就证明了人的伟大。它是一位伟大君主的可悲，是一个失了位的国王的可悲。

> All these same miseries prove man's greatness. They are the miseries of a great lord, of a deposed king.

#### 399

我们没有感觉就不会可悲；一栋破房子就不会可悲。只有人才会可悲。 Ego vir videns.

> We are not miserable without feeling it. A ruined house is not miserable. Man only is miserable. Ego vir videns.

#### 400

人的伟大——我们对于人的灵魂具有一种如此伟大的观念，以致我们不能忍受它受人蔑视，或不受别的灵魂尊敬；
而人的全部的幸福就在于这种尊敬。

> _The greatness of man_.—We have so great an idea of the soul of man that we cannot endure being despised, or not being esteemed by any soul; and all the happiness of men consists in this esteem.

#### 408

恶是容易的，其数目无限多；而善却几乎是唯一无二的。然而有某种恶却和人们所谓的善是一样地难于发见；
因此之故，人们就往往把那种特殊的恶当作了善。简直是需要有超凡伟大的灵魂才能够很好地达到它也象达到善一样。

> Evil is easy, and has infinite forms; good is almost unique. But a certain kind of evil is as difficult to find as what we call good; and often on this account such particular evil gets passed off as good. An extraordinary greatness of soul is needed in order to attain to it as well as to good.

#### 423

对立性。在已经证明了人的卑贱和伟大之后——现在就让人尊重自己的价值吧。
让他热爱自己吧，因为在他身上有一种足以美好的天性；可是让他不要因此也爱自己身上的卑贱吧。
让他鄙视自己吧，因为这种能力是空盛的；可是让他不要因此也鄙视这种天賦的能力。
让他恨自己吧，让他爱自己吧：他的身上有着认识真理和可以幸福的能力；
然而他却根本没有获得真理，无论是永恒的真理，还是满意的真理。

因此，我要引人渴望寻找真理并准备摆脱感情而追随真理（只要他能发见真理），
既然他知道自己的知识是怎样地为感情所蒙蔽；我要让他恨自身中的欲念，
——欲念本身就限定了他，——以便欲念不致于使他盲目做出自己的选择，
并且在他做出选择之后也不致于妨碍他。

> _Contraries_. After having shown the vileness and the greatness of man.—Let man now know his value. Let him love himself, for there is in him a nature capable of good; but let him not for this reason love the vileness which is in him. Let him despise himself, for this capacity is barren; but let him not therefore despise this natural capacity. Let him hate himself, let him love himself; he has within him the capacity of knowing the truth and of being happy, but he possesses no truth, either constant or satisfactory.
>
> I would then lead man to the desire of finding truth; to be free from passions, and ready to follow it where he may find it, knowing how much his knowledge is obscured by the passions. I would indeed that he should hate in himself the lust which determined his will by itself, so that it may not blind him in making his choice, and may not hinder him when he has chosen.

#### 424

所有这些对立，看来仿佛是最使我远街对宗教的认识的，却是最足以把我引向真正宗教的东西。

> All these contradictions, which seem most to keep me from the knowledge of religion, have led me most quickly to the true one.
