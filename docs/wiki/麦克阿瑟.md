Farewell Address to Congress , 19 April 1951

I am closing my 52 years of military service. When I joined the Army, even 
before the turn of the century, it was the fulfillment of all of my boyish 
hopes and dreams. The world has turned over many times since I took the oath 
on the plain at West Point, and the hopes and dreams have long since vanished, 
but I still remember the refrain of one of the most popular barrack ballads 
of that day which proclaimed most proudly that "old soldiers never die; they 
just fade away."

And like the old soldier of that ballad, I now close my military career and 
just fade away, an old soldier who tried to do his duty as God gave him the 
light to see that duty.

Good Bye.

我将结束我五十二年的军旅生涯。我在世纪之交之前就已加入军队，它满足了我孩童时所有的希望和梦想。
自从我在西点的草坪上宣读誓言以来，这个世界已经经历了多次转变，童年的希望和梦想早已消失得无影无踪。
但我依然记得当年那首流行的军歌中骄傲的叠句：一个老兵永不死亡，他只是淡出舞台。

就像歌中的老兵一样，我结束我的军旅生涯，只是淡出了人生舞台。一个力图像上帝指引的那样完成他的责任的老兵。

再见。
