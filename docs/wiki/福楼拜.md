L'homme n'est rien, l'oeuvre – tout.
The man is nothing, the work — all. (December 1875)
Slightly misquoted in "The Red-Headed League" by Arthur Conan Doyle as L'homme c'est rien – l'oeuvre c'est tout.

CCCI. TO GEORGE SAND, December, 1875

> I do not enjoy making "desolation," believe me, but I cannot change my eyes! As for my "lack of convictions," alas! I choke with convictions. I am bursting with anger and restrained indignation. But according to the ideal of art that I have, I think that the artist should not manifest anything of his own feelings, and that the artist should not appear any more in his work than God in nature. The man is nothing, the work is everything! This method, perhaps mistakenly conceived, is not easy to follow. And for me, at least, it is a sort of permanent sacrifice that I am making to good taste. It would be agreeable to me to say what I think and to relieve Mister Gustave Flaubert by words, but of what importance is the said gentleman?

THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE

> He shrugged his shoulders. “Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use,” he remarked. “‘L’homme c’est rien—l’oeuvre c’est tout,’ as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.”

《福尔摩斯探案全集·〈福尔摩斯冒险史·红发会〉》，天津人民出版社，张雅琳译。篇章结束的地方：

“太精彩了！推理像条长链子，环环相扣，衔接得完美无缺。”我由衷赞叹。
“这样才不会无聊，”福尔摩斯打了个哈欠，“唉！空虚感又要来了。我的人生目标是努力摆脱平庸，只有这些小案子能帮我实现。”
“你是为人类造福。”我说。
他耸耸肩，“哦，也许有一点点贡献吧。居斯塔夫·福楼拜写给乔治·桑的信中说：人很渺小，人创造的作品才伟大。”
