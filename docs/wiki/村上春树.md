> 假如这里有坚固的高墙和撞墙破碎的鸡蛋，我总是站在鸡蛋一边。是的，无论高墙多么正确和鸡蛋多么错误，我也还是站在鸡蛋一边。——村上春树（2009 年 2 月 15 日在以色列“耶路撒冷文学奖”颁奖大会上的演讲）

> If there is a hard, high wall and an egg that breaks against it, no matter how right the wall or how wrong the egg, I will stand on the side of the egg. Why? Because each of us is an egg, a unique soul enclosed in a fragile egg. Each of us is confronting a high wall. The high wall is the system which forces us to do the things we would not ordinarily see fit to do as individuals . . . We are all human beings, individuals, fragile eggs. We have no hope against the wall: it's too high, too dark, too cold. To fight the wall, we must join our souls together for warmth, strength. We must not let the system control us -- create who we are. It is we who created the system.
> -- Jerusalem Prize acceptance speech, (2009)
