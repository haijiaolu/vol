> You don’t find out who’s been swimming naked until the tide goes out.

```
1994年股东大会, <https://buffett.cnbc.com/video/1994/04/25/morning-session---1994-berkshire-hathaway-annual-meeting.html>

55. “You don’t find out who’s been swimming naked until the tide goes out”

WARREN BUFFETT:
...
And it’s what people have found out — and I used that line in the report a year ago — it’s what people have found out that were speculating on bonds with (inaudible) margins recently, that, you know, you don’t find out who’s been swimming naked until the tide goes out. And — (laughter) — essentially that’s what happens in reinsurance. You don’t, you really don’t find out who’s been swimming naked until the wind blows at them.

```

> We’re just swimming all the time, and we let the tide take care of itself.

```
2005年股东大会，<https://buffett.cnbc.com/video/2015/05/02/morning-session---2015-berkshire-hathaway-annual-meeting.html>

1.  Surprised that low rates haven’t sparked inflation
...
CHARLIE MUNGER: "Yeah. We have made very little progress in life by trying to outguess these macroeconomic factors. We basically have abdicated."

We’re just swimming all the time, and we let the tide take care of itself.

39. Unlikely that one person will run both investments and operations

……
CHARLIE MUNGER:……
So, I think it would be crazy not to go with the tide to some extent.
```

> After all, you only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.

```
2001年， [Warren Buffett's Letters to Berkshire Shareholders, 2001 Chairman's Letter](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2001ar/2001letter.html)

In assessing the soundness of their reinsurance protection, insurers must therefore apply a stress test to all participants in the chain, and must contemplate a catastrophe loss occurring during a very unfavorable economic environment. After all, you only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out. At Berkshire, we retain our risks and depend on no one. And whatever the world's problems, our checks will clear.
