第一章

在我年轻幼稚，不谙世道的年代，父亲给我的一条忠告，至还一直在我心头萦绕。

“每逢你想要对别人评头品足的时候，”他对我说，“要记佳世上并非所有的人，都有你那样的优越条件。”

他没有再多说什么，但是我俩彼此总能心照不宣，心领神会，因此我明白他的言外之意。结果，我养成了三缄其口，不安作判断的习惯，这个习惯使许多性格乖戾的人乐意向我敞开心扉，但同时也使我成为不少老谋深算的无聊之徒的攻击对象。心智不正常的人往往能很快发现正常人身上显露出来的这种品质，并伺机与之接近。于是，出现这样的情况：在上大学时，我被人们不公正地指责为政客，因为我能探微索隐，把那些性格捉摸不定、讳莫如深者心头秘而不宣的哀怨倾吐出来。大多数的隐私不是刻意追求得来的。经常的情况是，当我根据某个无 可置疑的迹象觉察到有人志忑不安欲吐心迹时，我便惺惺作态，昏昏欲睡，或心不在焉，别有所思，或者横生敌意，浮躁不安；因为我深知年轻人要吐露的心迹，至少他们的表达方式都是照搬别人的，而且因明显的压制而露出破绽。不轻率下判断是可望而不可即的。我现在仍然害怕有所闪失，怕万一我不慎忘了父亲对我的谆谆告诚，忘了那条我势利地反复诵记的忠告：人的基本道德观念出生时不是平均的，不可等量齐观。

I

In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.

“Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”

He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.
