### 诗歌

英文翻译
```
They aim at head, little do they know; revolution lies in heart.
I can't shoot a gun
I can't shoot a gun
My hands played the guitar
I can't shoot a gun
My hand only writes poetry
I can't shoot a gun
I only decorate, birthday cakes
Now that my people are shot at
With poetry alone, could I shoot back
I feel that is not fair
I reflect, a guilty conscience
I will shoot
I will shoot
When it's sure, words can't render
Must I carefully choose a gun
I will fire. 
```
